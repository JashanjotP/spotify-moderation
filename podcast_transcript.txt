don't need to bring it down it's bringing itself down she sounds like a boring Tik Tok blogger right now you
sound like a boring Tik Tok blogger boring Tik Tok
blogger oh [ __ ] you I'm the life of the party you little [ __ ] if I were on Tik
Tok I'd be the one making fun of all the basic [ __ ] and their [ __ ] avocado toast see she could get away with this
if she's really hot like this kind of behavior you can totally get through
life as a hot woman and be super successful with that kind of behavior havior but you got to be really hot to
pull off that attitude I think we need like a like a really hot Avatar how yeah
very hot how long before we have an actual sex robot that can talk to you like that uh probably not long not that
long right no I mean less than five years probably really yeah will it be
warm uh probably have whatever you want you can have a CAC go if you want yeah you
probably could right probably a furry um yeah you could have a furry lady that you have sex with yeah like an avatar
lady maybe a big giant blue lady that lives in your house yeah you know whoa
whoa with the tail yeah the whole tail you lock tails you got to get your out
with their tails or something yeah yeah they they link up they share souls okay something like that you know people got
you remember Avatar Depression was like a legitimate psychological or the no
after Avatar people got depressed cuz they wanted to live on that [ __ ] planet with those blue people and live
free they live pure yeah I didn't hear about this yeah Avatar depression it was like a real thing people were talking to
their therapist so much about being depressed mode too we try that what's
that depressed mode no don't do it that I think there is yeah we've got
like um we've got unlicensed therapist as a
when we were talking um when we ran into each other at the church at the inauguration you were telling me that
this is getting better and better so quickly that it's astonishing hey
ARA hey Alon how's it going today good can you tell me about Avatar depression
like if you see the movie Avatar but you can't live there so you get sad that's an interesting concept have
you ever experienced feeling so connected to a place or community that the thought of leaving made you feel
deeply sad so is this the depressed voice this is the therapist oh this is a
therapist what are some ways you think you could cope with that kind of sadness if it happened to you I don't have that
kind of sadness honestly I you I thought the movie would had some good special effects but I did not want
to live on the planet this is just coming from a guy who wants to go to Mars yeah yeah um oh
speaking of Mars what do you think about that crazy square that structure I guess
there are sort of squarish things on Earth you know planet's a big place so yeah but that one eventually it's going
to be pretty Square no it's it's alien civilizations of course that's what I think yeah yeah I mean what is it sorry
course if you if an alien civilization did exist though and it you know what happened got hit by an asteroid whatever
fting thought oh she won want ask she's like the hot lady at the party that interrupts the conversation so if if
that was the case like that thing that's pretty shocking like especially ancient ruins you look at like what it
looks like when they they highlight the actual structure of it it looks like ancient ruins and if you had ruins of
something made of stone and it got hit by an asteroid millions and millions and millions of years ago who knows what it
would look like right now that just looks oddly created looks oddly
manufactured well i' probably well maybe we should go there and check it out yeah
and see what it's like is there um ways that we can get better photographs it seems like that's a pretty good
photograph though yeah I mean my view is we should move to Mars well not move to Mars we
should have a second planet uh to preserve civilization right um because
let's say hypothetically I mean maybe that maybe those are the ruins of a long dead civilization um that will probably
happen to Earth at some point you know it's a matter of time before uh we get hit by an asteroid
or uh maybe we do we annihilate ourselves with nuclear war or super
volcanoes or super volcanoes exactly yeah there's a lot of things that could happen to us it's not a bad idea to
hedge your PS yeah yeah uh genetically engineered super
virus yeah this episode is brought to you by LifeLock tax season is already stressful
you shouldn't have to worry about identity theft on top of everything else and trust me it's a big worry especially
since during tax season your sensitive info does a lot of traveling to places you can't control it goes through
payroll your accountant or your tax consultant and countless other data centers on its way to the IRS any of
them can expose you to identity theft because they all have the info on your W2 just the ticket for criminals to
steal your identity it's no wonder last year the IRS reported tax fraud due to
identity theft went up 20% you need LifeLock they monitor
millions of data points per second and alert you to threats you could miss if
your identity is stolen LIF loocks us-based restoration specialist will fix it back by the million dooll protection
package and restoration is guaranteed or your money back don't let identity

apply they keep doing it yeah that's what's crazy they're going yeah they
didn't shut them down no the Wuhan lab was they were just talking about one that has a 30% fatality rate that they're working on yeah uh why are we
doing that yeah for what reason you did it for so many years and you didn't have a cure what could possibly go wrong also
wouldn't be the reason to do that so you could develop a cure at the same time and clearly you didn't have a cure so
this is really foolish and bizarre yeah um I think we should stop
stop trying to genetically engineer super viruses it's insane I mean when
you're going through all this USA stuff yeah like here's what's weird first of all what is it like to buy a company for
$44 billion and then people call you a Nazi on that same thing that you bought I did not see it
coming it's like it's classic people will gobl anything down
yeah oh he's never going to stop wa wait what um what is it like like all the
people used to the left was in love with you and now the same idiots are calling you a Nazi it's the most bizarre thing
I've ever seen in my life um I mean there's so many examples of people saying my heart goes out to you you did
it with a little enthusiasm that probably wouldn't be recommended with hindsight yes but there's obviously um
me in the most positive spirit possible yes obviously obvious but it's so strange where people want to think that
you are openly public publicly doing Secret Nazi sey hand motions and now I
can never point at things diagonally I can only point at things there and there and then I say you have to divide that
yeah because that's where the spaceship is over there it's ridiculous it's ridiculous when um CNN when I was in all
my trouble absur every time CNN used a photo of me it was one of the photos from the UFC weigh-ins where I go like
this welcome to the weigh-ins so every photo was me every photo was me with it's it's so
crazy it's delate propaganda so they they they know it was not it was obviously not meant uh it in a negative
way that it was that I literally said my heart goes out to you and it was very positive the entire speech was incre
very positive uh I was being very enthusiastic about the future in space um and the you know
um the the was a great crowd you know so he got a little pumped up yeah it got
pumped up exactly yeah that's all it is obviously obviously obviously there's video of Tim wals doing the exact same
thing doing the exact same thing right exact same thing and he said of course
it's a Nazi salute he said that right right this is how crazy things have gotten like well it's I mean it's it's
coordinated propaganda so um the
you know it's yeah coordinated propaganda the I mean doesn't it seem weird that the Legacy Media all says the
same thing they all say the same thing at the same time using the same phrases they they barely even they don't even bother picking up a thesaurus right so
uh like right before um you know the the debate between Biden and Trump Shar
everyone was saying sharp is like who says shop is attack but yeah exactly you know it's like it's not a common phrase
it's definitely not to be repeated on air with multiple people simultaneously
that's weird yes that's coordinated 100% 100% yes yeah like
hundreds of people saying it simultaneously uh they just got their instructions yeah so I mean essentially
the um you know the the Dem leadership or you know political leadership did
they issue their instructions and their puppets carry it out yeah and they're just like puppets in a puppet show and
that's the problem that I see with all this Doge stuff because everybody should
be celebrating that we've found a way to cut out fraud and waste yeah if you pay
taxes and you don't like that you have to pay so much in taxes and then you
find out that there's significant fraud and waste that's been exposed you should
be celebrating it this shouldn't be oh no the wrong people found this fact and
now it's a bad thing yes and then there's the [ __ ] propaganda the mind
[ __ ] of calling it us Aid instead of the United States agency for International
Development it sounds like it's feeding hungry people where people are going to starve Elon this is horrible and then
you find out actually it's like $250 million for transgender animal
studies literally mutilating animals yes mutilating animals in demented uh
studies yes uh that are like the like the worst thing you could possibly imagine from a horror show the Beagle
one the beagle puppy one hor where they they covered their head in a basket and put fleas on their head so they eat them
alive yeah and then they studied these beagles and then killed them like what do you going to learn from that that's
good for anybody yeah this some some really some psychotic stuff that happens
so um yeah I mean the
I guess uh the the the real threat here is to
the bureaucracy so um like you probably saw like you know let's say like Trump
is a threat to our democracy which is ironic since he was elected with a majority of the you know popular vote um
they they started saying I was a threat to democracy but if you if you just replace threat to democracy with threat
to bureaucracy it makes total sense right so
um I mean the reality is that our elected officials have very very little
power relative to the bureaucracy until Doge so doge is a threat to the
bureaucracy it's the first threat to the bureaucracy normally the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast this is
the first time that they're not that the revolution might actually succeed that
we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy now the size of it yeah was
when you guys first started investigating it when you first get in
how much of it was shocking like this just the size of it all well the size of
it all the small decisions result in multi-billion dollar outcomes uh so you know we'd see there
was a case where we saw uh one person was getting $1.9 billion was sent to
their NGO which basically got formed about a year ago and had no prior
uh really no prior activity so they just stand up a you know an NGO the these the
whole NGO thing is a is a nightmare um and it's it's a misnomer because if you
have a govern funded non-governmental organization you're you're simply a govern funded organization it it it's a
it's an oxymoron right it's a loophole yes it it basically the un funded NOS
are a way to do things uh that would be illegal if they were the government but are somehow made legal if it's sent to a
so-called nonprofit but these but these nonprofits are then used to people Cash Out These
nonprofits they become very wealthy through nonprofits they pay themselves enormous sums through these
nonprofits that's it's so insane that that's been going on for so long it's a
gigantic scam like one of the biggest maybe the biggest scam ever and how many
NOS uh I think there a total number of ngos probably Millions but uh in terms
of large NOS tens of thousands uh I mean it's it's actually
it's it's it's kind of a a hack to the system where you know someone can get an
NGO stood up for for a fairly small amount of money like George sorus was really good at this like he really
George sorus is like a assist hacker like he figured out how to hack the system he's a genius at Arbitrage um I
mean these days he's he's pretty old but a genius at Arbitrage so he he figured out that you could leverage a small
amount of money to create a nonprofit uh then Lobby the the
politicians to send a ton of money to that nonprofit so you can take what might be you know uh a $10 million
donation to a nonprofit to create a nonprofit and leverage that into a billion dollar non NGO nonprofit is a weird word it's just
a non-governmental organization um and and then you can the government continues to fund that every
year um and it'll have a nice sounding name like the institute for peace or something like that um but really it's a
graft machine and what are their requirements with that money what do they have to do
just really no requirements at all so they just get grants and the government just assumes that they're doing good
work I think a lot of people in the government know that they are not doing good work uh but they it's a giant graft
machine um I mean people online are like unpacking
this you know um it almost seems fake like when you're seeing how we were we
were covering this article that said 55,000 Democrat NOS were discovered that had been contributing to campaigns and
moving things around and doing pushing propaganda and they were all connected they found it AI that you have to go
through steps and steps and steps to figure out where the money's coming from oh it's all funneling down to this group and this group does
that yeah it's a a giant propaganda machine a giant regime change machine
yes yeah uh yes I mean but doesn't it does it do
some good as well know it does some good so it's like there's it's not like 0%
good uh if it was it's if it was like if it was really 0% good it be much easier
to attack so they there's going to be some percent good that they they add in there but it's like it might be 5% or
10% good but 90 95% not so is there a way to audit all this stuff and find out
oh these people are actually just sending food to poor people these people are actually just helping people with water in third world countries is
there's a way to do that and keep funding those uh yeah I mean we we have continued to fund things that appear to
be legitimate even with the flimsiest if if there's even the flimsiest excuse like I just say like send me a picture
of the thing like you could literally have ai generate the picture but if you're not even willing to try to trick
me then we're like not going to send the money okay so what restrictions were put
on was there was some uh something set aside like medicine and there there's
what was what was set aside that there was there like work for like Ebola prevention I I actually don't just know
if this work is even effective uh it may may not be like it could be the kind of thing where you you sort of fund Ebola
prevention but it turns out that actually you're funding a lab that develops new Ebola vir you know recipes
or something you know yeah uh and they they claim it's Ebola prevention but it's actually Ebola creation so some of
these things I I don't know I mean just um but it just seems like we you
know we shouldn't be sending taxpayer money to dubious Enterprises overseas right yeah yeah and why are we doing it
like what exactly is the reason is it because we want to make friends with these people so the Chinese don't take over the Russians don't take over okay
how much of that is like a good thing how much of that is smart to do and how much is a grift and without any sort of
oversight which has really been going on for so long they've just had Free Run
yeah well it also we just have a real issue with the the the budget deficit
it's gigantic so um like if you know all
things being equal if if we didn't have a gigantic budget deficit uh where interest payments uh the interest on the
national debt exceeds the defense department budget uh which is truly astounding which mean so we're paying
over a trillion dollars of interest on the national debt um then okay would
have more room for wasting money basically um but when uh when we're
spending so much money that the company that the country is going bankrupt uh then we really need to stop stop
spending money if uh unless we're sure it is good value so essentially we're like a poorly managed business with an
unlimited credit line that is off the rails absolutely and if you were a
person like you are who comes in and takes over businesses and straightens them out that's exactly what you're
doing I mean most of the time I create businesses from scratch like Twitter was a case where you know I kind of bought a
company that was I kind of knew it was a hair bow well you came in Tesla in the beginning but they were already doing
something right no Tesla did Tesla did not exist in any meaningful form that it was there were no
employees uh JV St and out joined three other people there was no car there was
no nothing so wasn't even a prototype yet no oh okay I thought there was a
prototype already no there weren't even any employees oh wasn't a f that's a funny narrative
that people like to say that you didn't even create Tesla then yeah that's [Laughter]
wrong so if you're handling the Govern government like a business you're going to have to go through all of these
departments and do the exact same thing that you're doing with USA so how do how do you how does that scale up like how
many people do you need to do something like that well we started off with about 40
people u i maybe 100 people um and
really just going through doing very basic things here uh it's uh as bad as
Twitter was the federal government is much worse so
um you know in the case of Twitter it wasn't a profitable company it was like
basically a break even company but at least it was break even and it had to pass an audit the the federal government
is not break even uh it's literally losing $2 trillion a year um and it does
not pass its audits it fails its own audits so like you know there's a case
where um like I think Senator Collins was telling me about how she she gave the
Navy $12 billion for more submarines got no extra submarines um and then held a
hearing to say where' the1 12 billion go and they were like we don't know that was
it uh I mean the basically stuff is so crazy it's like only the federal
government could get away with this level of waste of of waste it's mostly waste it's mostly not for it's mostly
waste it's it's mostly just ridiculous things happening um because they've been able to do it this way for so long and
they' become accustomed to it yeah I mean it's like Milton Friedman said like money is most poorly spent
when when you're spending someone else's money on people you don't know how much
are you going to care right and that's the that's the federal government so they they're spending
someone else's money on people they don't know now imagine any other business that was this badly run that
complains when you want to check the books and audit it and go through all
the decisions that have been made and go through all the ledgers and like yeah what did you do well the people
receiving the money uh want to keep receiving the money yeah yeah yeah clearly yes
so but you know I mean the reason
I'm the reason I'm uh putting so much effort into this is that I think it is a very dire situation it's
not a you know um it's not optional basically so
um yeah yeah America's going bankrupt so that that that just can't happen it's
just bizarre to me that that some people aren't willing to look at it correctly they they're not willing to see like how
much chaos this is how much waste and fraud there is how much how much could be trimmed and how
just because people have jobs doing [ __ ] doesn't mean your tax dollar should pay for this [ __ ] yes um I
mean we found just with a a basic sear of the Social Security database that there were um 20 million dead people
mocked as alive but were they getting money some of them are getting money what percentage of them
uh it isn't clear we're actually trying to run the I was trying to get an answer right before the show um what it looks
like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly but because they are marked as
alive in the Social Security database that they can get then get disability Unemployment uh sort of fake medical
payments and other things because they're marked as alive uh in the Social Security database so it looks like it's
a bank the the the fraud is a bankshot essentially the they bankshot uh into uh
Social Security uh they just do an areu alive check and then uh get fraudulent
payments from every other part of the government oh yeah and and this exploits
the the the fundamental weakness in the government is that the various govern databases they don't talk to each other
or they they talk to each other very poorly in a very limited way so the way to the way that the system gets
exploited is is by taking advantage of the the the poor communication between
the various databases in the government um to give you an example of like what's happening in sayate uh
treasury which is improving rapidly um the the main uh payments computer is
called Pam uh like payments account payment accounts Master database or something like that but everyone calls a
Pam um that's responsible for almost $5 trillion payments a year roughly a
billion dollar an hour and um when we came there we're looking at this payment
it's like the the payments have no uh you could put a payment through with
with no payment categorization code and and no description on the payment like
basically untraceable blank checks um this is the kind of thing that if if it was done as a public company uh
the company would uh be immediately delisted and the uh executive team would
be thrown in prison but this is just normal at the government so we said okay
our recommendation to the treasury and the Federal Reserve was like we need to make the the payment categorization
codes mandatory not optional and you need there needs to be an ex an an
explanation we're not judging the quality of the explanation but there should be some explanation for what this payment is for above
nothing that's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now um
I my guess is that probably saves a 100 billion a year Jesus Christ
that money going rough rough order magnitude where was that money going well so this is where you get into
the the sort of gray boundary between waste and fraud um if money is sent to a
person or or organization from the government um and you didn't really deserve it but
the government still sent it to you is that waste or fraud right um
so I mean there's a lot of payments that where someone just appr approved the payment but then that payment officer uh
changed jobs or retired or died um and the payments just keep going you know
it's like if you forget to pay your gym membership or something like that right now imagine it's not the gym membership
you said your gym membership's $20 billion a year or something you know um but they forgot to turn it
off there like that happening at scale in the government Jesus it's totally
nuts is what I'm saying so insane yes it's totally insane so what did you
expect when you went in did you expect it would be like this I thought it's I thought it would be it would be bad but
I did not think it would be as bad as this um I mean look the the good news is
that uh it's a target-rich environment for saving money uh it's not like
uh you it's not like if it it was a very well-run ship uh it was very efficient
it would be hard to improve but it's not efficient so therefore it is
actually relatively easy to improve let's just say it's not rocket science you know I know rocket science
so it's a lot of uh mundane things um so
and some of the some of the things are like so crazy that we didn't even know to ask about that because we just
assumed umed like you know payments out of the treasury computer would have a payment categorization code and they
would have some explanatory note saying what the payments for the idea that that it would be just untraceable blank
checks uh didn't occur to us at first Jesus so anyway just this episode

so is that one one of the things that accounts to there there's this 4 something trillion dollars that's kind
of they don't know where it went they don't know that's a c I think that's
probably a cumulative number um yes so yeah but yeah if you if you add
up it's do you remember that story Jamie yeah what was the story almost what she
said there like they just didn't have accounting for it I think yeah it was spent on legitimate things worry but we
don't we don't know what we spent it on well I mean how do you know obviously
one cannot say it's was spent legitimately if they don't know what it was spent on that doesn't make any sense this is this is such a fascinating time
because with this setup the way it is right now with Trump back in after all that happened to him and with you there
and with RFK Junior and Tulsi and cash Patel it's like this is a wild time to
find out what really going on that's like never happened before this is nothing like the first term no like the
first term he had a bunch of neocons in the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady people that he didn't know and he had to
appoint all these different people maybe he got some bad picks now he's had four years to Stew on it right and with you
guys all going through this we're getting an understanding of the government that we've literally never
had before yeah this is a revolutionary cabinet and maybe the most re tionary cabinet since the the first
Revolution uh this is this is not a bunch of business as usual uh types so this is why you know
some of the the standard confirmations were quite challenging is because when you when you put to try to appoint
people who are going to change the system yeah uh the system doesn't want to let them through but it's fascinating
because it's like the vampires all out themselves like now everybody knows who the system is like if you're just lying
about us and then they come and you talk on aast and expain what's like he's
starving mothers there's mothers that can't get food totally false that's all you're hearing yeah that's that's no
one's talking in any of these mainstream liberal talk shows no one is talking
about all this fraud and waste yeah because we're cutting off their graph machine so that that's what they're
upset about that's that's the real thing they're upset about U and if if if people want to know what uh do is
cutting and and I want to be clear like these are cuts that Doge recommends to the department and usually these
recommendations are followed but uh these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department um the uh
you can see line by line what do is done at Doge Dogo so what if we do we put on do. goov
so you can see everything that is being done and there's a Tracker that shows is it how much money has been saved yeah
yeah and you can look at each line item and and you know they like a bunch of these sort of sort of far left uh shows
will will say like oh it's a constitutional crisis blah blah blah but what they won't do is point out which payments are wrong right so my challenge
to them is point out which payments are wrong yeah go through it which which of which of these sort of waste fraud
things are wrong which line explain that line to the public they won't be able to
right yeah that's why you're not hearing any specifics you're hearing an stories about mothers we can name the specifics
yeah line by line and we got the receipts and here's the other thing if you're post the receipts and if you're only talking
about the propaganda talking points and you're not talking about the very clear fraud and waste it's very obvious what
you're doing yeah you're just gaslighting yeah yeah totally yeah so exactly because we're say like look in
fact I've said we're going to make mistakes we're not going to be perfect uh so if we make a mistake we'll quickly
fix it so we'll we'll we'll you we need to act fast uh so stop wasting billions of
dollars of taxpayer money um but if if we make a mistake we'll reverse it
quickly right you know so it's also this interesting narrative that you shouldn't
have access to this social security information as if no one's had access to it before as if the Biden Administration
in 2023 had there was like 53 people some of them were students that had
access to all this stuff yeah uh as it is there are uh tens of thousands of of
federal employees that have access already to the system uh anyone from Doge has to go through the same vetting
process that those those federal employees went through so there's not like some unvetted random
situation if for example there's a security clearance needed uh the Doge person has to have that same security
clearance so there's no um reduction in
security um but I mean obviously the the the vast numbers of social security
numbers have leaked onto the internet people have hacked the the government systems multiple times uh vast amounts
of public information has been hacked and and uh DED on to the Internet so I
me there's a guy at the IRS that leaked a half a million tax returns just a few years ago on purpose
yeah for what reason uh I for politic he he he he wanted to I think he was trying
to get a trump and maybe me and a few others um so but he he he he stole like
500,000 uh tax returns like not a few like it's a lot
of tax Jesus Christ yeah oh I remember that story now remember you just you
just read about it online it's not it's a real thing so these are the narratives
that's the narrative that you shouldn't have access to social security the the other narrative is that starving people
are going to die and women aren't going to be pregnant and not have nutrients for their babies and that's that's all
you're hearing and um yeah well that's the that's the that's the only thing they they can say but they can point to
the line item right um and so they can't say like well this is the thing where
you know the nutrients for pregnant mothers were stopped this they can't
point to that because we didn't right is a lie what's fascinating to me is um how much
the mainstream media is in line with the very specific talking points and how
little you you have Fox News you essentially have Fox News on television it's like the only one that is pointing
out the ridiculous fraud and waste and yeah you know I know you saw the Jeff
Bezos thing in the Washington Post they're going to stop all the wacky editorials and and limit that stuff to
uh I think it was uh wealth and personal freedom or something along those lines yeah yeah so I mean I think it's
this kind of I think it makes sense uh because he's just talking about the things not not the the sort of just
talking about the opinions opinion pieces the opinion pieces yeah yeah so the regular journalism stays the same
well it's a detriment to their business I mean you're seeing over and over again people that just they don't want to hear
all this [ __ ] from these people anymore it's like you're you're you're saying it's almost like you're caught in an
outdated version of the virus and everybody else already has the immunity
to that virus like this is yeah you know like you need you need a new mind virus
the one that you're pushing it's like it doesn't work anymore it's too crazy yeah
uh it's the whole thing is very crazy um I mean the media is incredibly partisan I mean they're not uh I they take almost
all the media is um you left shifted yeah so it's like it's kind of weird if
you talk to somebody who gets all their information from like what I call Legacy Media uh they're living in a different
world yeah uh than if they say are listening to you know U your podcast or
um are getting new news from from X or you know just if it's it's like it's
it's kind of wild like it is very wild like you talk it's it's like they're living in an Ultimate Reality oh there's
a lot of people that I talked to to that I have to go where did you hear that yeah yeah uh but I mean like the
Associated Press which I call Associated propaganda the AP um you know they they
ran a a international news story saying that we that Doge fired air traffic controllers but we didn't fire any air
traffic controllers at all in fact we're trying to hire air traffic controllers not fire them yeah I saw that you you
made a tweet about it right yeah what do you call it now do you call it a post post yeah whatever you can't call it a
tweet though do you call it a tweet accidentally I don't know listen uh but like if you if if one like
let's say somebody post if somebody puts up like an you know two hour long video
that's not a tweet right it's a post it's a PO yeah good point yeah yeah for sure yeah so um but I hot over if people
still want to call it a tweet whatever you put a post about it just to get back to it saying that if you we need highly
qualified air traffic controllers if you retired if you would consider doing it again we could use you uh yes so uh a
lot of really qualified air traffic controllers were were pushed out because of Dei stuff so um I mean not to to be
blunt I mean a bunch of old white a bunch of really good talented old white guys were pushed out it's not cool um
and so we have there's a talent shortage in a traffic control because of Dei and
and and not being not hiring people on Merit you know which is so crazy that that worked I think we we should not put
the public safety at risk you know because of some demented philosophy somebody made a post today about it in
infiltrating the NSA did you see any of that that was that was some gnarly stuff
yeah crazy what they they they it started off as just like this sort of Fringe thing and people would meet up
then it completely infiltrated the organization and they were spending all their time there like 400 people or
something some like some chat sex chat room with like some extremely demented
stuff yeah yeah I I know I sa it I'll send it to you Jamie because it's so
cooky you you you what this is the NSA I thought the NSA was just all about like
information and spy on you know like if like is a
national threat or something yeah I think this is exactly it um so she uh
more than 100 intelligence staffers will be fired over sexually explicit texts in NSA chat rooms Gabbert says um so so top
intelligence official told Waters that the workers in question were Brazen and using an NSA platform intended for
professional use to conduct this kind of really really horrific Behavior Uh what is the behavior what exactly what is it
do they say in this article uh yeah I think they were also okay it says
employees who participate in the n's obscene pornographic and sexually explicit chat
rooms your tax dollars at work well it was all like de I it was all like LBGTQ
stuff it was there was a lot of like transition stuff and yeah I I know I definitely saved it
but point is um it had infiltrated the organization it's not what they should be talking about at all at all at all
supposed to be protecting the country right and if you and people were talking about how they're sping half their time
in these meetings and that they're just like constantly having to attend these things where they talk about these
issues like what are what are you doing like if you have a problem with someone that's discriminatory get rid of that
person that's it yes it's you problem's over you got someone who's homophobic in
your business they're openly homophobic yeah that you can't work here that's not cool that's it that's it you don't have
to have [ __ ] meetings constantly promoting this you're not going to change someone's opinion by berating
them over and over again yeah I mean a work environment should be a professional environment where you know
they're they're they're getting the job done that they're you know you know being paid to do uh that
it should be obviously not supposed to be sort of getting paid for bizarre SE
sexcapades it's just so fascinating that the virus was so strong that it made it
into the NSA yes and was you would think those are some hard the CIA too the CIA
was in there too yeah they were in there too which is bananas you would think same thing like hard-nosed like tough
people doing hard work who can spy on you whenever they want yeah yeah and get revenge on you
whenever they want yeah pretty wild yeah and you know they
exist when the president leaves they stay people move around you stay a part
of the organization for your entire career you get deeply entrenched in their system and how things work and
who's back to rub and who's who's a bad guy who's a good guy who's on our side who's not
yeah it's scary actually yeah um so was
that what's taken so long with this Epstein files yeah what's up with that what is up with that it was like yeah
it's it's like Lucy and the football with Charlie Brown when she always pulls that football away it's the same thing
it's like they keep telling us they're going to release it day one oh day one we have a serious case of no one's being arrested O phobia you know well there's
also right like what the [ __ ] is going on what the [ __ ] is going on also there's this real fear that someone's
destroying the evidence and you keep hearing these stories unsubstantiated stories yeah of you know FBI people
where the evidence I mean the guy had like tons of videos and uh recordings yeah I mean he had all sorts of things
right like there's a mountain of evidence right so where's that mountain yeah where where is that mountain and what would be the reason why they would
agree like there would have to be something in it for them to agree to not
put it out right like there has to be some sort of
financial entanglement some sort of relationship with the people that are on that list yeah that they can provide a
value that was big enough for you to not release it or to slow relase it or to hope you can get away with like putting
out some redacted files that don't show anything this is only red redacted
redacted only stage one don't worry the real stuff's coming like that doesn't make any sense like why wouldn't you
just release it all like what what could possibly be well worth protecting in
there I mean I think I've got probably the same information that I mean I'm just reading what's what's the latest thing on the X you know I'm just looking
at my X feed and I'm like yeah you know it's a real page Turner
um and like I thought we were going to get some re Revelations to it was like big binders full of stuff there's got to
be something in there well there was in all those people that were given a copy of it they were all like waving around
they got the Willy Wonka ticket yeah yeah totally yeah and what happened nothing nothing so I think Laura lomer
released it online I think I'm watching TW yeah she's not very pleased about
this so does anybody find anything in there that's interesting no it's all old stuff from 2015 and okay what the [ __ ]
is going on but but then apparently this they discovered a whole bunch of stuff at the southern dist District of New
York right so that's and and and I'm like and I me I think you know Pam Bondi
is actually great and cash Patel are great but they're like they just got there you know right so then they're they're in not they're they just got
there but they're they're in a hostile environment they're not in a friendly environment right um so um you know it's
like if you suddenly got put in captain of a ship but the crew was previously
your enemy right the entire crew was previously your enemy right you know and you're telling them give me evidence
yeah the crew doesn't want to give you the evidence you enemy they were like your mortal enemies just a moment ago
you just got there yeah so yeah I think we got to give um you know um the
attorney general and you know new director of the FBI some a little bit of slack here because they literally just
got there I think so too but hey don't say you're going to release it on day one then yeah you shouldn't have said
that sure and don't say you got a big drop coming tomorrow and that's some
[ __ ] that's been around forever it's disappointing yeah what the and where's the JFK files where are those yeah let
them go did they release anything on that front I don't know what's going on it can't be anything that's gotten to me
yet so if nothing's gotten to me yet it can't be signicant if there's conspiracy evidence someone's going to send it yes
Tim Dylan's going to text me 100% Tim Dylan Dave Smith someone's going to send my way theu yeah so it has it hasn't
been released yet yeah you would find out and here's the real question like what could even be in there at this
point that they haven't cleared out if you've got paperwork from 1963 like what is in there still what is in there that
could possibly be incriminating that supposedly Trump said that if you saw
what they showed me you wouldn't release it either okay what the [ __ ] does that I haven't seen it so Cashel has yes he
said he seen it all yeah um can he just post it to his like X account or
something I mean I just we that sounds like an Elon move I don't think he can he's the director of the FBI I think he
has to go through proper channels and does he he has the channel I yeah but there's rules he sounds like Trump he
sound like Trump he needs an executive order what about the storm I am the
storm I mean what channels he is the channel well again imagine just getting
to the the hull or just getting to the uh deck of the ship and you're the captain yeah and now you uh you have to
figure out who's running things who's doing this where is everything yeah um
yeah just getting getting anything done like just like said you're you just
joined as Captain of a ship of where the crew hates your guts yeah they were your enemy yeah they were your enemy they're
strongly opposed to anything you want to do yeah um and you're trying to give them orders and you're trying to expose them yeah they don't want to be exposed
right you're you're literally people that are working there probably a part of this problem I mean I I was reading
onx that like comey's daughter is like the lead prosecutor in southern district of New York did you read that yes and
and like so obviously there's a bit of an entanglement there a little bit like what if there's something that uh you
know makes puts her dad in a bad light exactly she a [ __ ] Shredder hit
that delete button you know did you see uh General Flynn he
was on a podcast and he he spoke directly to James Comey yeah he said Jim
you're going to jail and unless you give up someone deeper than you and you know who that is you know who I'm talking about like
that is wild yeah um I think that the former director of the FBI might be
really in that kind of deep [ __ ] and he really actually was doing some evil corrupt [ __ ] while he run in the FBI I
mean it seems like there's some very shady stuff that's been going on um it seems like it definitely happened in
the' 60s right everybody kind of admits to that they admit the FBI uh killed black panthers they they did they did a
lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of stuff that went on that we know the government did way back in the day yeah why don't we
just data dump the files just like go in there take photos of of all the papers
presumably paper um and just post it online and and uh let let the CHS fall
where they may is it presumably everyone like some like filing cabinet somewhere I don't know right where is it where's
where's the magic filing cabinet how are they hiding it who's got access to it like this this is what I was hoping day
one I was hoping but obviously it's taking a lot longer than that so I I
think part of it is like you know like let's let's say let's say you were made direct to the FBI okay I might be able
to that's what crazy literally you know what's he doing now he's he's one of the big dogs of theba but
he Secret Service guy yeah legit guy but people think of him as a Fox News guy just like Pete heg same thing they don't
want to think about his distinguished military career they want to say oh that Fox News guy director deputy director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation I mean Dan's hardcore I me if he if it's if it's reasonably findable I think he's
going to find it this is between him and cash I mean like I think they're going to get stuff how crazy would it be if they couldn't though how crazy would it
be if they can't find anything if it's that if if everybody shuts their mouth and everybody covers their ass like an
FBI computer where you type in the search that's I I just like the basic mechanism here like it's either in a
filing cabinet in in paper where it's like you know maybe there's like Progressive levels of security you know
you're like open this door oh you got to have do you have the pass for this level you like level unlocked and there's a
level unlocked and it's like get there
laptop yeah yeah there's laptop you gotta only plug it in it's in a skiff
yeah this is why like I think I think like tour of four KNX would be awesome like a live tour of Fort Knox we can
actually see it's like is the C there or not they say it is is it real or did somebody spray paint some lead you know
imagine if it's not imagine if it's not all there like some of it's missing where to go what if a lot of it's missing what if like half of it's
missing I mean who how do we even know I don't know they said the last time they let someone look at it was decades ago
yeah well the last I believe the last formal audit was in the 50s so I'm like okay oh my just think
about all the other maybe yeah think about all the other stuff that you pointed out all the
the the checks that just go out the the NGO payments the Social Security people think about all just all that now apply
that to the gold absolutely I just want to like emphasize the sure Madness of the the government it's it's just
because they have like m the Magic Money computers that that they the checks all the checks never bounce for the federal
government like so you don't have the the normal corrective mechanism that you'd have for a company or for an
individual the checks just always always always clear the net result is inflation which is effectively a tax on everyone
um but uh you know like the defense Pro hasn't passed an audit in I don't know
how many years seven years yeah I mean exactly so it's like You' have to be freaking Chuck Norris to like only Chuck
Norris could get the defense department to pass an order you know typee of thing that's the level of skill you need you
know um well that's what's so insane if you bring it back to the idea that it's a business well yeah this would never be
tolerated in any kind of functional business exactly so U you
know um you know Pentagon will will like like their accounting error like the
stuff that that they lose in the couch cushions is like 20 30 B billion dollars a year they don't know don't know where
it went it's gone where it go and it's
gone it's so insane it's insane it's so insane so that's why I said like even
simple things like just requiring that the that outgoing payments for the treasury computer have a payment code
and a comment of what the payment is about and someone to call about the payment um I think will have an very
powerful effect in stopping wasteful outflows and stopping fraud yeah and and
here's another way to look at this imagine if some there are people like you and the Doge team out there in the
world imagine if one of those works for an organization like us a or any other
organization and has this understanding of how much fuckeries involved but they
have evil intentions and they're entwined in this system for decades and decades and they've built a career and
all the entanglements that come and they start moving [ __ ] around
you could probably do it easy it sounds like the way you've laid it out if you were a career person who's in there
forever who knew how everything works Y and you were very clever you could make
some [ __ ] happen and you could probably do it in conjunction with some people that you know that are forming an NGO
hey let's all work together yeah yeah
and this is the resistance that you're facing yeah the I think it's the biggest scam of all time this is not something
you ever saw the biggest scam of all time ever of human history of human history yes
wow I think you're right yeah I how what else probably a trillion dollar scam
there's never been a trillion dollar scam you know now this is not something that you
ever set out to do this is not you didn't have this as a career aspiration this is not like this is the most absurd
outcome I can possibly imagine actually also like Doge started as like a sort of a a meme coin right you know it was like
a a joke cryptocurrency involving memes and dogs mhm um and uh which is so funny
that the letters wind up being perfect yeah well actually I was originally going a quote like the government
efficiency commission which is very boring name um and then people online were no it needs to be the department of
government efficiency uh and I was like you know what you're right of course of course of course I mean it's more
evidence of the simulation that that little like a mascot is a is a cute
dog it's a meme coin the meme coin is probably worth a lot of money right now right like every time you tweet about it
probably I don't know shoots up yeah the the mem the whole meme coin thing is
bananas yeah it is so bananas that people dump real money into these coins
and then you could just pump them up and sell them a casino or something I don't know yeah it's totally G people just do
whatever the greater fo and musical chairs and whoever's like the last to sit down lose type of thing and somehow
or another it's still legal like that's that's think not I think not too many
people I mean I mean it's sort of like you go to the casino like you if you expect to win
at the casino you're being a fool okay so I think if you expect to win at meme coins you're being it's not you're being
foolish yeah yeah you're not gonna win a meme coins it's like it's it's but if if
if you want like don't sink your life savings into a meme coin no but you can gamble a little and you can ride waves
and win a little and lose a little if if you want to have some fun and and don't come then you know play have play with
me and coins but if you put your if you put your on a m coin in the at the RIS
of saying something bold and outrageous don't bet the F on a mcoin the weird one is the pump and
dumps like people all time all the time and people get shocked that somebody
pump and dumped like what is what are you doing did you like I was hoping to
dump I was hoping to make all the money out of this I can't believe they got me like yeah it's just weird that it's
legal still uh I mean casinos IL legal and and
people just lose money at casinos you know but you can't rig a casino like a pump and dump you could rig a pump and
dump you know uh yeah I guess so um like you could run a real pyramid
scheme well I mean the government's one a big pyramid scheme if you ask me yeah well you you can tell Social Security is
is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time right explain that oh so um well people
pay into Social Security um and and the money goes out of Social Security immediately but the obligation for
Social Security is uh your entire retirement career so you're you're
paying uh with your the you're paying like like if you look at
the future obligations of Social Security it far exceeds uh the tax
revenue far have you ever looked at the the the debt The Debt Clock yes okay
there's there's there's our present day debt but then there's our future obligations so when you look at the
future obligations of Social Security um the actual uh national debt is like
double what what people think it is because of the future obligations ah so basically people are
living way longer than expected um and uh there are fewer babies being born
so you have more people who are retired and get that that live for a long time and get retirement payments so the
future obligations so H how bad the financial situation is right now for the
federal government it will be much worse in the future at the risk of being a buzz kill here
did you see so we better fix what we got right now because if it's bad now it's going to be much worse in the future there was an interview with this woman
who was a whistleblower did we ever find out if that was true there's so many whistles being blown it's hard to keep
track a lot of whistles this one lady it was only in one state it was very
specific instance believe right but it was using Social Security money correct that was her that was her allegation so
what what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning uh illegal
immigrants into clients that's what they would call them and that she would go to them and try to ask them do you have a
headache do you have back problems if you do now you can be permanently disabled you get permanent disability so
you get Social Security for Life yes yeah no not just Social Security but disability which is even more right and
you get them for on the taxpayer Dole right away the m and they're illegal aliens yes oh so if I were to say like
what's at the heart of the sort of like why is a Democrat propaganda machine so
fired up to destroy me that's the main reason the main reason is that uh is
that um uh entitlements fraud that includes like Social Security Disability
Medicaid uh entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a
gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here like basically
if you if you pay people uh at a standard of living that is above 90% of Earth then you have a very powerful
uh incentive for 90% of Earth to come here and to stay here but if you if you
end the illegal alien fraud then you that you turn off that magnet and they leave and they they stop
coming and and the ones that are here many of them will simply leave
and if if that happens a massive they will lose a massive number of democratic voters and if it didn't happen they
would turn those people into voters correct which they were trying to do they are already turning them so in in
New York state illegal aliens can already vote in state and city
elections a lot of people don't don't know that there there's I mean they're trying to fight that in they're trying
to stop that but it's there currently I think it's like 600,000 uh are Reg said to vote illegal
aliens in New York that is wild yeah well well I mean if you look at
say um you know FEMA like the the agency that was paying for illegal aliens to
stay at luxury hotels in New York was FEMA the F you know that's meant that
that's an agency that's meant to support Americans in distress from natural disasters was paying for luxury hotels
for illegals in New York it's true yeah that's a fact fact they're literally
like when we stuff that payment we we stopped all those those money because that's obviously an insane way to spend
taxpayer money um the uh New York uh sued the government Su the federal
government to get the money so you can just look at their lawsuit they they were give they were
sending that money even after president Trump signed an executive order saying
it needs to to stop they still press sand on $80
million to luxury hotels in New York your tax money went to pay for illegal
aliens in luxury hotels in New York from an agency that is meant to help
Americans in distress from natural disasters right and I would like to know
how much and I would like to know how much they spent on North Carolina and how much they spent on Maui yes
exactly uh what What's actually happened is they're buying voters that's really what's happening
it's like it's like a giant voter for scam they're importing
voters and uh and it's really just a matter of time so like a lot of people
have trouble believing this but if you the more you look at it the more you
will realize just how much of a problem this is and how it's it's it's not just
real it is it is an attempt to destroy Democracy in America that's what in my
view it is what it really is like if you take the the the sort of seven swing
States like often the imin of Victory there is like maybe 20,000 votes if you
put 200,000 um illegals in there and they have like a 80% likelihood of
voting them uh and it's only a matter of time before they become citizens then those
swing States will not be swing states in the future and if they are not swing States we will be a permanent one party
State country permanent uh deep blue socialist State
that's what America will become and that was the game plan that that was that was the game plan that is still the game
plan and they almost succeeded if if if if the if the machine of which the Kam
puppet was the representation had won that's what would have happened the
reason I went so hardcore for for for for Trump was because to me this was a folk in the
road very like a very obvious folk in the road um if they had another four years they
would legalize enough illegals in the swing states to make the swing States
uh not swing States they would just there would be blue States then then they would they would
win the presidential they'd win the house the Senate and the presidency
um they would then make uh District you know DC into a state may maybe Puerto
Rico get four extra Senators pack the Supreme Court so then you'll have the house Judiciary
Senate uh and presidency all blue and then they will keep importing more
illegals to cement that that outcome basically what happened in
California Jesus Christ it would have been the end that's why I went so hardcore for
for trump it was otherwise been the end and that's why the the the Democrat
machine is so intent on destroying me it's just so fascinating that people
can't see this I mean I invite people to do their research the more they do their research the more they will see that
what I'm saying is absolutely true D it's like just do the research
yeah it's it's such a bad idea even for the Democrats which is what they don't
understand like it's the same it's not ultimately going to work out no it's the same people yes it's just they're doing
it under the guys that they're the kind compassionate Progressive people yes but
the same outcome takes place it's just about control they they probably Institute some Central Bank digital
currency and some social credit score system and censorship of course yeah of course well they that was the big Fe
coming into this election was that if they can't censor things like well I we talked about it before but there's there
was two major Forks in the road the big one was Trump didn't get shot y the other big one was You by Twitter and if
those two things don't happen the whole world looks different yes yeah we don't
want to be on that timeline no we don't want to have only one side represented because guess what they will hijack that
side whatever it is they will hijack that side and use it for money and control and that's what it's all about
it's not about good people versus bad people it's a [ __ ] shell game yeah I I mean I think these things are actually
it's easy to understand if you look at basic incentives the the basic incentive
here is the more legals that the Democrats can bring in the more likely they are to win so that's what they're
going to do um that's what they have been doing uh and it worked in California
California super majority Dem um and look at all the companies that are leaving California
yeah um I mean in and- out just announced they're leaving their headquarters leaving California they're moving to Tennessee yeah yeah
so um and and California uh made Healthcare free for illegals yeah as of
last year so and and that obviously that's a gigantic magnet for more illegals like and this is not a thing
you can solve simply with money because what happens is the you simply have more patients than a doctor can possibly see
and you can't just you know make doctors out of nothing like the it so people
like oh it's just a money thing no you it takes a long time for somebody to become a doctor you know the 30 years um
and uh and so what actually happens in California is that there are too many
patients for the doctors to see so then uh the average citizen in California
suffers as a result um now the the elite in California are fine because they have
private doctors you know they have they can they can just pay for the best doctors so the elite in California doing
fine but your your average C citizen in California is not doing fine um and the
the tax burden for uh healthcare for illegals was supposed to be three billion I think they now estimated it's 9 billion but that but that that number
will scale to Infinity basically it's like why not like why not if you if you
need any operation at all come to California and have it be free right from anywhere on earth and the people
that want to look at it in the most charitable way they say oh well these people are hardworking good people and
they're the backbone of our city and they should have access to all the things that we have access to and I just
don't think they understand that it's a political Pawn I don't think they understand this is not done for
compassion and kindness no this is just done to ensure that it stays Blue correct yeah and it's essentially a
bribery with your tax dollars yes this is why um that the dams will not even um
Deport criminals yeah um because every criminal deported is a lost vote so even
even if if somebody is uh um illegal with a criminal record and commits crime
in America they are still still were not being deported and then on top of that
California made it actually illegal to ask for ID when people vote Yes
California and New York uh you are not allowed to show your ID when you vote I
just want to be clear so everyone understands this in California New York you are not allowed to show your ID even
if you want to right why would that ever be a good
idea I mean what like if you want to man if you're trying to do if you're trying
to facilitate fraud in elections it's a great idea that's the only reason yes there's no other reason Lally why that
would be a good idea it's for fraud it's it's like it's like wake up
she wake up hello like let's say you wanted to commit for what are the things
you would do yeah you would say you don't need ID and you can mail in your ballot and we'll give you free healthare
yes stay here yes stay here I know it's on fire but stay here I mean in this case it being on fire is not just a
metaphor in California okay it's just like godamn
entire neighborhood's burning down it's just once they uh allowed people to vote that are not legal in
California once you if you're if you're going to do that it's it's over it's exactly there's there's no coming back
from that the numbers are just no people are so indoctrinated too there's so many people that no matter what they think
voting Republican means you're an [ __ ] yes and they won't do it they won't do it they they'll put their
[ __ ] rainbow flag on their porch and they'll just ride it right into the beach civilizational suicide yeah right
to the Rocks bang crash the boat I mean uh there's there's a guy um who post X
who's who great God Gods side yeah friend of mine he been on podcast punch times yeah he's awesome yeah he's great
um and he talks about uh you know basically suicidal empathy mhm like if
there's like there's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself yeah
um so that we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on and it's like
I believe in empathy like I think you should care about other people but you need to have empathy for for civilization as a whole and not commit
to a civilizational suicide also don't let someone use your empathy against you so they can completely control your
state and then do it insanely bad job of managing it and never get
removed the the the fundamental weakness of Western Civilization is
empathy the empathy exploit they there it's it's they're exploiting a a a bug
in western civilization which is the empathy response so and I I I think you know
empathy is good but you need to think it through and not just be programmed like a robot right
understand when empathy has been actually used as a to a tool yes like the it's weaponized empathy yeah is the
issue yeah weaponized empathy and yeah um and it's also the rigid adherence to
that liberal ideology like you can't switch sides over there like California
if you're a part of that whole Tech Hollywood entertainment any any of those
circles you're on the left like almost wholly almost completely it's borderline
illegal to be a republican in California uh I mean like in San Francisco or La
it's borderline illegal to be a republican you're certainly shunned no I look I mean in like San Francisco you
you you could shoot heroin while taking a dump on the mayor's car in front of City Hall okay and and that and nothing
would happen to you but if you walk down the street with a Maga hat you're GNA get
attacked yeah it's insane yeah it's insane it's also so orwellian that a hat
that says make America great again would cause people to have a violent reaction
like aren't you American wouldn't just just as a a whole like the saying wouldn't that be a good thing for
everyone make America great again but because it's attached to Donald Trump and that red hat you'll get maced for
wearing that red hat they will make America worse by beating you so it's
like it's an evil thing they're doing a violent assault in America because you want to make America great
again I mean it's like a scene in a book it doesn't it doesn't seem like it could
be that ridiculous like remember when all lives matter would get you fired which is insane insane people got fired
because they said all lives matter which is a very reasonable thing to say how reasonable is that yes that's
essentially saying everybody matters but that's not that's Lally all you're saying that's not what you were supposed
to say you had to say black lives matter which of course they do if you say all lives matter everybody matters yes but
the idea of being a colorblind Society was completely abandoned somewhere around
2012-ish yeah I mean I I sort of can trace it to when when did the the the gun emoji get nerfed you know uh when
did it turn into a squirt gun that was a couple of years ago that was like 2016 I think was it yeah yeah it became a
squirt gun can you bring it back X yeah no no right now if if if you uh use a gun
emoji on X the Apple will insist that it' be a squirt gun and then the X app
turns it back into uh a 1911 oh really yeah oh that's great so you can you can
actually uh you know have have a 1911 gun um we we we reverted the Apple
change inside the app oh that's hilarious that's hilarious that that it's that thing's so offensive the gun
and then the pregnant man both of those got me like you
[ __ ] I mean I like that mem where it's like the people telling you that what you're hearing is dis
information are the same people that did the pregnant man emoji yes yeah think about that yeah well also the same
people that say a woman attacked a Tesla Factory yeah the woman it's a dude it's
a dude like really obvious dude really big mentally ill dude yeah mentally ill
dude with a wig on say that yes yeah but NBC even fo you're looking at the
picture a woman yo this is got a this this is a dude with a wrong jawline okay
he's wearing Woman face is a buff it's a buff dude yeah it's a buff dude wearing Woman face I
mean come on that's not a that's not a woman yeah and they're like saying watch shot for disinformation I'm like what
are you talking about it's so crazy this is [ __ ] I mean it's just more evidence of the virus though right like
it killed objectivity killed reality and it it demanded strict adherence or you
were attacked yeah yeah any questioning of it uh would result in in being ostracized do you
like what what kind of responsibility do you like knowing that if you didn't take
over Twitter and turn it into X if that didn't happen like the I really think
the world's a very different place right now like how long have you owned it for
a couple years basically imag imagine a couple years of it being run the way it was run before and probably accelerating
my account would have been suspended long ago for sure yeah for sure yeah just for
the disinformation yeah um it would have been Trum would
have never come back Alex Jones would have definitely never been back definitely not no no um
so yeah um does that weigh on you like I would feel like that would be a [ __ ]
heavy responsibility yeah um I mean I'm just trying to keep
civilization going here you know for longer um
so um I think we at least want to build a
city on Mars um and become a multiplet
civilization uh which I think would be incredibly important in ensuring the
long-term survival of civilization are you still rescuing those people that are stuck in the space
station uh yeah that's coming up in a couple weeks I think whoa they've been up there for how long Jamie they were
supposed to be there for a couple days right I think actually prob like four weeks oh they're supposed to be they were supposed to be up there for like
eight days yeah and they've been up there for like I think eight months so a little longer than expected [ __ ] yeah
what is it going to be like for those people when they get back they're going to be a wreck for a long time right yeah if as long you stay up there you get you
know sort of in zero you get increased bone loss so um you it ended up being like this
political football um and uh sort of sort of hotly contested topic um we
offered to bring them back early this offer was rejected by the Biden Administration whyl for political
reasons that's so crazy I there's no way that they're going to make anyone who's supporting Trump look look
good wow what do you think they would have done if they had
won uh well get those people back no they can they can only get them back with with a SpaceX spacecraft but they
they push the return date past the uh inauguration date wow
yeah so they would have let you do it but after the
wow and so it would have been them authorizing you there isn't anyone else to to to do it NASA can't get them uh
the only only the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them
back so the NASA concluded that the Boeing spacecraft was not safe so that's
why they're stuck there holy [ __ ] yeah and you can't ask Russia to help that would be awkward a little bit yeah yeah
be a nice thing if they did they said guys will help you I think they for enough money they would you think so uh
yeah but they would they would obviously treat it as a propaganda Victory and charge crazy
money it's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool yeah um yeah um so well they were
also the Biden Administration was also suing SpaceX uh they had this massive lawsuit against SpaceX for SpaceX not
hiring Asylum Seekers right so so people like say like oh El's making it up this
V Administration wasn't against SpaceX I'm like bro the Department of Justice
had a massive lawy law suit against SpaceX for not hiring Asylum Seekers even though it is illegal for us to hire
hire anyone who is not a permanent resident so it is both there's a law
that says you have to hire Asylum Seekers but there's also a law that says anyone hired by a rocket company which
is an advanced weapons technology must be a permanent resident and if an asylum
Seeker is not a permanent resident so it is both legal and illegal to hire Asylum
Seekers so why would the vien Administration
launch a massive lawsuit again this is public information it's not like my
imagination um why would they launch do such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX they're extremely
antagonistic it just doesn't make any sense that that could ever even get past
the first day of someone looking at it if it's both illegal and you're trying
to enforce it like you can't enforce it yes this is an advanced weapons company this is crazy it should be like this
throw this out there's in fact there's like International traffic and arms regulations is a like a law that is
there to ensure that if if only permanent residents of the United States
can work at Advanced weapons companies Rockets are Advanced weapons uh so the
same is true of like if it's like nuclear or you know some like you know bioweapon thing or something like that
um so because they obviously if if someone were to work at basic and then
go leave and go to North Korea or Iran they could build missile technology that could uh you know destroy the United
States so that's why you're not allow to hire people who are per resident logical basic logical logical so is that lawsuit
still pending I was it was just dismissed how long was it going on for a
couple years holy [ __ ] yeah that's the other thing that drives
me crazy like that people don't understand that if you sanction laware
like that if you sanction attacking your political enemies someone's going to do that to you like if the wrong people get
in office yeah if new people getting off four years from now eight years from now who knows who it's going to be you've
already set a precedent you've already attack someone charged them with 34 felonies where they're really just
misdemeanors and they're passed the statute of limitation and now you're talking all over the news that this is a
convicted felon convicted felon they kept saying convicted felon convicted felon and everybody knows what it is yes
it's terrifying it's terrifying they could do it so brazenly to a guy who was the president for four years right um
that lawsuit was funded by Reed Hoffman uh who is a major damned
donor and also an FD and client [Music] uh the pl the plot thickens the plot
thickens Jesus Christ yes it's
just it's so blatant it's like so obvious the SpaceX lawsuit the Trump stuff it's just it's so obvious yes like
known FC clients um who are obviously extremely powerful um they powerful
politically and and very wealthy um are you know bullate
um Bill Clinton and Reed Hoffman and some others two but those
three so you know why was Reed Hoffman so intent on destroying
Trump do you think it's because they're worried about the list coming out yeah one of the
reasons yeah so I mean I'm like this is you know
yeah so it's so frustrating to be sitting in the situation where the the list isn't coming out well it better come out I
mean hopefully tomorrow might well I mean why' they release [ __ ] today I don't know what's the point in giving
these people like a a happy folder to wave around in front of the camera with nothing in it that's new doesn't make
any sense it's not encouraging uh like I said it's the tough thing that
they've got is you know they've been made captain of a ship with a hostile crew right right so they don't have like
you it's not like you you have like magical powers you get made captain of a triple the Hostile crew you still have a
hostile crew right um you've got to bring in people who are going to you be
helpful as opposed to OB obstructionist right
um so um but yeah I think the the public
will be right frustrated if there is if no one is
prosecuted for the FC Client List no one at all which you don't know
like is you know like at least I don't know the top five or something like some
number should there should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders well particularly if galain
Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking yes cuz like well trafficking sex trafficking occurred right so she was in
she's in jail for it yes so to who are the clients yeah yeah how
do you put someone in jail and you don't even name the clients that sounds kind of insane I think yes it it it
would yes because just stunning that they've been able to hold it back for so long it's really kind of amazing like
when people say that people can't keep secrets what the [ __ ] are you talking about look at this yeah I mean a bunch
of these things are not like it's it's common knowledge but we just we don't actually have the proof
right um so the proof is there I mean there's lots of videos
um yeah there's lots I mean the dude it's like a mountain of like whenever
they raided fen's place there would have been like a mountain of evidence where is that mountain right what' you do with
it yes like Who took possession of the evidence yeah specifically right the individuals where are the tapes yes how
many levels of clearance do I have to get to get into the Vault Yeah
well yeah yeah um you know what we need are people
who are really good with computers oh yeah and really good with
technology remember seeing this photo that's when they raided his home they were that's they on the island they were
there then yeah they got everything I'm sure I mean there must have been so much stuff on that island there must have
been and if it wasn't there where was it yeah what you know it has to be uploaded
somewhere there has to be some sort of a chain of evidence yeah or chain of custody there got to be a mountain of of
evidence yeah um the other thing they're going to talk about is uh uaps they're going to release all the UAP information
so you're the GU to ask about this what what if any possibility is
there that there is some sort of advanced propulsion system technology that's being worked on in
secret and that they're trying to cover this up with this talk of aliens and
alien Tech and not of this world and is it possible that there's some sort of
very secret program that's going on in cahoots with some defense contractors
that are developing Advanced propulsion systems that they're using for these drones
uh I mean SpaceX um you know my company
SpaceX is has the most advanced rocket technology in the world I think I'd know
right um and I the best of my knowledge there is not any magic there there's not like
some super Advanced propulsion technology there have been people who have theorized different gravity drives
and different is there anything that's ever gotten past the theoretical stage
no nothing well there's nothing even that I'm aware of that works in
theory it's not like I don't I I would like this to exist to be clear I would like this to exist um and I have the I I
I from a security clearance standpoint I have top top secret there there is I
have equivalent of like an all access pass from a security clearance standpoint so
uh I I'm I don't think they're hiding it from me basically I don't think they they could um unless it's completely in
these weapons manufacturing corporations I mean I know these weapons manufacturing companies like boing lucky
to northr I mean yeah they do some interesting things but uh they do not have I there's no breakthrough that they
have so I'm confident they do not have a breakthrough when you hear people like like why just compete with SpaceX and
make a better rocket in which case you know they can make why are they holding back on making um a lot of money from
beating SpaceX with better Rockets my thought was that what if it's just a
drone and you can't have a biological entity inside of it because it just bursts from the [ __ ] speed that it's
moving at that a human couldn't tolerate the amount of force so they're just
drones I don't think so so what do you think people like Ryan Graves Commander David I want cool things to exist like
say like do I want UFOs to exist yes I want UFOs to exist because that would be
really interesting course everybody does yeah it would be cool it's it's a more boring world where UFOs don't exist or
or like flying like Advanced propulsion stuff doesn't exist that's a if if it
doesn't exist that's more boring I'd like it' be more interesting if it did exist I'd like it to exist I hope we
find something but I have not seen like I mean like SpaceX has launches 90% of
all satellite Mass to orbit so if you take all of Earth uh rocket all of Earth's rocket
launchers my company has a 90% market share of Earth China does about 5% and
the rest of the world does including the Boeing lock North and everyone does
5% so why why wouldn't they use this to defeat
SpaceX yeah yeah would no listen that's why I asked
you it would make sense what do you think these people are seeing a rocket every two days but what do you think
these people are seeing when when you have reliable people like Commander David fraver who had that Infamous
ticktock uh Tic Tac experience off the coast of San Diego where they got this
thing on video they tracked it going 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 ft in like a second okay yeah yeah and then
they also have video evidence of this thing accelerating at a great speed eyewitness accounts from two different
Jets sure um I mean can we does anybody have a
high-risk video or photo of this thing well there's a video of this thing where they're locked onto it and and then it
takes off it shoots off frame no no it's like whatever the systems they used on
fighter jets in 2004 potentially like Windows 95 I me there like somebody did a curve of like the resolution of UFOs
and the resolution of cameras U UFO resolution has stayed flat
despite megapixels and cameras going like you know super high well according to Christopher Mel why they still blurry
Christopher melan who worked in the state department said that they have high resolution photos videos of these
things and that's all that he's seen it it's all locked away whenever people say that to me like don't even tell me that
then don't unless you have just leak it for God's sake put it out there like let it slip yes yeah uh I mean there's a
couple photos they're grainy there's not one thing that I've ever looked at and go holy [ __ ] that's it that's what I've
looking for you could ask our Gro AI right now to create a h highres image of
of an alien spacecraft uh you know over Austin yeah and it's going to do a great
job so why we do we not have at least that
right yeah but I want to believe that's the problem my brain starts going oh come on this is no fun I want it to be
real I want there to be at least be some Advanced propulsion system if not like
what are all these people seeing like what is h if we're not being occasionally visited by things that are
smart enough to hide we might be I just that these aliens are very subtle yeah you keep saying saying that it's a good
good line I mean it's a solid line cuz it's pretty accurate I just want to see
some high RIS video of aliens like how are they just evading all the cameras if you think about that and the ones that
you do get them on that's just like some Far Away light that's moving weird and it could be a lot of things but I want
to believe yeah I mean I mean there've been like multiple times where um you know
the Air Force and navy is has called SpaceX and as and said they they they think they've seen aliens and we're like
was it at this time on this state in this location they're like yes how do you know that's
us there been a lot of that that's our satellites those are our satellites they're like no they're not I'm like
yeah yeah they're they're definitely our satellites oh yeah people see the SpaceX satellites all the time whing by yeah they're last our satellites and they're
they are moving at you know 16,000 mil hour so it's pretty fast um and there's
also stuff that the United States government does have that gets mistaken for UFOs I remember the first time I saw
a stealth bomber we were filming Fear Factor it was like right after uh 2003 like right after the the war had
broken off and they were flying a stealth bomber down in Palmdale I was like holy [ __ ] like if I didn't know
what that was I would 100% think that's from another world when you see cool
[ __ ] cool yeah really cool I mean it doesn't look like a a humans it looks
like something from battl Star Galactica you know it does look yeah it does look awesome um I mean they're they're not
stealthy against any uh Advanced radar system by the way it doesn't work it doesn't work anymore doesn't work no was
it old school stuff they're they're only they're only stealthy against uh old Radars oh okay I mean you can still see
them like they're not invisible right right they're not like oh it's not like
you know uh cloaking device from Star Trek did you see when me and Lex uh we
we watched the the rocket get caught live while while it was happening that to me was
one of the to see it actually I've seen videos of it happen but to see it actually live was one of the coolest
[ __ ] things you're like wow we are in the future right I mean nobody else can
do that yeah it's true nobody else can do
that that's fact yeah it's pretty wild it's cuz I'm an alien it's time
you I'm an alien and I keep trying telling people I'm an alien but they don't believe me I believe you okay
thank you I believe you that's my my suspicion all along was that you I'm trying to get back to my own planet that
you're a friendly alien like it's nothing wrong with aliens I like people from everywhere yeah even other planets
what's next like now that you can do that you can catch Rockets what's like the ultimate expression of Rocket
technology like what what comes after this
um well I mean the fundamental breakthrough we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully
and rapidly reusable orbital rocket where both stages are fully and rapidly
reusable with our Falcon rocket we are able to reuse the main stage and the the nose cone but we're we're not able to
reuse the upper stage um and it it's still takes us a you know at least a few
days from when the main stage lands to when we can flly a gain so it it doesn't
it doesn't it's it's doesn't it's not fully reusable because we lose the upper stage uh which cost $10 million to build
and um and then and then the the main stage it's it's not as reusable as like an
aircraft you can't just like refuel it and fly it requires um work for a couple days um
but this the Starship design is the first design that is capable of full and Rapid reusability
where that is one of the possible outcomes um and once you have full and
Rapid reusability the cost of access to space drops by a factor of 100 it's like
100 times cheaper um by some metrics it's a thousand times
cheaper and um and then when when you factor in uh
orbital re re refilling so you refill on orbit uh it it can drop the cost of
going cost per ton to the surface of Mars by a factor of
10,000 whoa yeah so what has to improve in order to make it
reusable um well
um we need there's there's some like we're pretty close to being
able to re rapidly reuse the booster for Starship um that's why you know it it
comes back and gets caught by the arms and then the arms place it back in the launch Mount so um now this still you
know um we have a little bit of engine damage we got little bit of heat shield
damage um there's uh like there's like tweaks that that are needed but but the
but we're pretty close to achieving full and Rapid reusability of the of the booster um the ship we we we're I mean I
I think we'll achieve reusability of the ship this year um and I think we'll
achieve rapid reusability of the whole stack ship and booster next
year um this is the fundamental breakthrough required for life to become
multiplanetary and what is what needs to improve in order to make it reusable like what is what's wrong with it right
now uh on the shift side the the toughest problem is the heat shield so
no no one has actually no one has ever developed a fully reusable orbital heat
shield because you come when you come in from orbital velocity you come in like a flaming meteor like you're just a raging
ball of fire um and it's it's hard to have a heat
shield that doesn't partially melt or get destroyed in that process um you know that that wasn't a
problem we were able to solve with falcon9 that's why the opper stage uh burns up on re-entry
um with the with Starship the the the the ship portion you got the the booster and you got the ship um we got to solve
the making a fully reusable orbital heat shield a problem that has never been
solved before um for a while I was like I'm not sure there's this is solvable at this
point I think it is solvable um it requires detailed iteration on the heat shield
tiles um and I mean we've vertically integrated the manufacturing of the heat
shield tiles because there there was no supplier that could provide us with the materials that were needed so
the um you need to make essentially this this very
fine verelli of of glass and aluminum
oxide uh fibers um aluminum oxide is basically
Sapphire so it's like glass and Sapphire very fine fibers in exactly the right
geometry uh with special Coatings um in order to have the this
heat shield tile be reusable um like not melt um and but not be so
brittle that it gets damaged um on Ascent or descent um like it can't be as you know
it's it's kind of like almost the brittleness of a coffee cup type of thing um and the Rocket's shaking like
hell so you got this thing like you saw it firstand like imagine you're at Ground Zero of that rocket like you feel
how much shaking it was when you're like 5 miles away imagine if you're right there you know so you got you're shaking
these things that are like as brittle as a coffee cup trying not to have them crack or
break um and then not have them melt um you got several thou several thousand of
these things um you know and if even a few of them
break it's not reusable so is there Innovation that's being done in the materials technology at SpaceX where
you're you're constantly trying to find and tweak a better version of this yes
it's a very difficult problem no it's a problem no one has ever solved so we've got to get the exact right uh materials
combination uh the the right molecules in the right shape and and then apply those that heat
shield perfectly to the rocket with no mistakes um there's a reason that no one
solved this before it's a very difficult problem so um like said we we had to vot
integrate the entire manufacturing of the tile from basic raw materials to a
finished tile um rebuild like build the entire supply chain from basic raw
materials so where you're just inputting uh silicon uh silicon and
aluminum oxides and what is the difference between the way you guys do it versus the way they used to do it for
the space shuttle uh
well I mean the the space shuttle um like space shuttle Leading Edge uh used
uh like quite dense Caron Caren tiles like it was um they're like basically
thick and heavy uh but also subjected to cracking that's like what what happen is the foam broke off and it's it hit the
tile cracked the tile then on Entry the the cracked the tiles that have been
cracked or broken uh weren't able to Shield the the shuttle and so the the
the the plasma got in melted the the primary structure the whole the whole Space shut broke apart yeah so you you can't basically
can't have something that's as brittle you know brittle like the space
shuttle there's footage of that right yeah yeah um uh and Rain debris over the whole
United States so yeah and they got almost all the pieces um the the
I mean the full the full technical explanation would would would I think be understood by about six people um
listening to this um like the there was a lot of brilliant engineering the space
shuttle tiles um and and and and a bunch of the heat shielding wasn't even tiles
it was actually uh silica blankets like you know um felt blankets essentially um
if you look closely you'll see it actually is uh they're actually Heat Blankets not not tiles in in some areas
um but but they they would have crack tiles and they would have occasionally the tiles would fall off there were a few close calls U where tiles fell off
but they weren't in a super vulnerable position uh in the on the space shuttle um so but it would take it would take
them several months like eight nine months to refurbish a space shuttle between each flight so it was it was it
was not reusable really um and and certainly
wasn't rapid so
um like I said very hard problem U you've got to have you you've also got
to ATT sort of attach the tiles in a way that
um enables the the structure underneath to move uh to expand and contract ah um
even though you've got these very rigid tiles um so like the
the main the the tanks which take on cryogenic propellant will contract when
you put in the cryogenic propellent but then when you come in and you get very hot they will expand so now you're
you're expanding the you're Contracting and expanding the gap between these rigid tiles but how
much uh it varies depending on where you are on the on the on the vehicle so if
you're in the um if you're in the cryogenic tank section like the I mean
you can see like a 10 20% difference in the Gap um really it's pretty significant yeah it's enough that you
can't just put all the tiles you can't just Jam the tiles together if you if you put them to if you if you actually but buted them up um they would they
would all crack because there's too much movement there's there's also some amount of body bending so as the the
ship is like ascending uh you know when when the engines steer
there's a little bit of movement um so if the tiles are too close together they they'll they'll essentially just crack
and snap like how you have to have a gap like how PL yeah like plain Wing will move yeah plain body will move
too wow and how you have to have some Gap but if you have too much of a gap then the the the heat gets gets to the
you know get gets past the the tile and uh melts the the structure holy [ __ ]
it's a hard and how large are these tiles I mean they're like that big that's it well
they're not all exactly the same size but yeah we're sort of a hexagonal tile and they have to essentially be you
can't like 3D print the whole thing you can't have one structure it has to be tiles because it has to have that
ability to move well there's no 3D printer that's I mean the biggest ones are like
maybe 3et you know there's no you you can't you print it um nor nor would you
you have to have something that can move right uh it has to be able to fle to flex um like so you got expansion and
contraction um you you're really D like you're you know you're um you're putting in liquid
oxygen which is likeus 300° fah um actually we we subcool it to you
know- 330 Dees fah um so it's very cold
and then it will be several hundred degrees maybe a th000 deges fahit
potentially um in went on re-entry so you have this huge temperature swing so
the the thermal expansion is substantial and the whole and you got thermal expansion and contraction combined with
body bending so you have to take the worst case Body vending and thermal expansion
contraction this was a very hard problem yeah yeah Del delicate balance but
you're confident that you guys are going to be able to crack it at this point I I I'm confident that it is solvable
yeah it just needs a certain amount of versions of it that's why when these things blow up you're like yeah we
expect them to blow up yeah what would be really helpful is for us to get the ship back um so we can
study where like where we had cracked tiles or lost tiles why why did we you
know why did we have a cracked all L tiles was because maybe the tiles were the Gap was too big too small maybe
there was a a height difference between the tiles um maybe we need to change the
chemical composition um you know there's we we
just want if we can get the dam ship back intact we can we can iterate a lot better um which we'll get it back intact
um so I think we'll get it back intact this year um but that that's why I think we
we'll we'll probably recover the ship sometime this year and then um we might
be able to refly one with a but probably with a fair bit of work by the end of this year but it's going to take us many
iterations before we can achieve rapid reusability where the ship comes back
lands get gets caught like the booster with the arms and can then and then arms plac it
on top of the booster and it launches again whoa
so like I said that's you know reduce cost of access to space by a factor of 100 and what is the process of returning
these people that are stuck in the space station well we we we I mean we send SpaceX dragon to the space station all
the time and we've um we've now taken people to orbit and back was taking over
50 people over over 50 astronauts
so it's just a matter of doing it yeah and is it a matter of waiting for we do it routinely basically it's not a we've
we've been doing this for a few years so when is this Rescue Mission going to
launch um yeah probably about um um about four
weeks or so it's depending on weather and other considerations uh about it's
about a month away well that'll be uh I'm sure a welcome moment for those poor
people that are stuck up there so so it's a bit of a political football so
they're not going to complain um no I'm sure they're football but obviously we we could have brought them back way
sooner that's so [ __ ] up so let's let's take it past the point where you
have these scales you have a reusable ship yeah and you've you've got it
dialed in then what are the steps what are what what's next step after that is
it an unmanned ver Voyage to Mars first unmanned fly to Mars um the Earth and
Mars um orbit synchronize every two years um or every 26 months technically
so um the next orbital synchronization is November of next year so and you can
launch plus minus a month roughly so we'd have to launch in November or December of next year and so the the
default plan is to launch hopefully several Starships to Mars at the end of
next year and what would they be doing well at first we're just going to
try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing um do do we succeed
in landing like let's say we were able to send five ships do all five land intact or do we uh add some craters to m
um if we add some craters we've got to be bit more cautious about sending people you know and we need
to so we got to make sure the thing lands safely how does it land on Mars uh
with on Rockets Rus so it'll just land oh we'll add legs okay it'll just land
and have legs and so it'll be remote controlled from Earth
or just autonomous autonomous completely Mars is uh you can't remote
control things from Earth because Mars yeah it's too far speed light you have speed light constraints so um Mars at
closest approach is roughly four light minutes um and uh when it's on the other
side of the sun it's it's about 12 light minutes so you know round trip would be like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on
the other side of the Sun so once you do that then how long do
you think before you start sending people up there um well we're going to try to go
as fast as possible um you can think of this as really
um a Race Against Time can we make Mars
self-sufficient before civilization has some sort
of Future Folk in the road where there's either like a a war nuclear war or
something or a we get hit by a meteor um
or or simply civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a
bang um I think we can do this
in I don't know at least I think we do it within 15 Earth Mars synchronization
events you know so basically like 30ish
um if if we have an exponential increase in you if if every year if every two
years we have like a a major increase in um the number of people in tonage to
Mars like I I think as a rough approximation we need about a million tons to the surface of Mars maybe a
million people that kind of thing to actually have a civilization yeah the and would you
terraform like what would you do you would eventually terraform at first people would live in some kind of
protected environment like domes and underground kind of thing um terraforming would take too long
um I we're at this point in time where in the for the first time in the 4 and a
half billion year history of Earth it is possible to extend Consciousness beyond
our home planet and um that window may be open for a long time or it may be open for a
short time I hope it's open for a long time uh but it might only be open for a short time and uh we should just make
sure that we extend the light of Consciousness to Mars
before some uh before civilization either
extinguishes or subsides you know all that all that
needs to happen is that the technology level of Mars drops below or technology level of Earth drops below
what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars so if there's some really destructive
war or like I said some natural cataclysm um or or simply the birth rate is so low that you
know we just like I said die in adult diapers with a whimper that's one of the
fossil outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way by the way so Japan is Right Japan Korea yeah yeah I mean at at
at dangerously yeah at current birth rates in three generations Korea will be
about 4% of its current size that's insane yeah maybe maybe even
less than that um they're they're only at 1/3 replacement rate so if you if you have three generations that one that's
you're 127th uh of your current population which is 3%
dis Jesus Christ yeah basically population class laughs happens
fast um so and seems to be accelerating in most parts of the
world so so basically I mean from my standpoint I'm like this is the first time it's been possible to extend life
extend Consciousness beyond Earth maybe that window will be open for a long time but it might only be open for a short
time we should make sure that we make life multiplanetary and make Consciousness multiplanetary while it's
possible well that's the goal goal of SpaceX it's ly a smart goal if you take
into consideration how vulnerable this planet really is I mean there there's always some new story about something
that might come and hit us 30 years from now it's a 3% chance and and we really
can't stop that right now right I mean there's really we don't really have the technology
currently to even know how many rocks are coming our way right there's stuff that comes behind the Sun that we can't
see until it's pretty close then it's our way yeah now what is the fear of
your It's a Long Journey to Mars you're sending people it's a six month how many
months will it take six uh yeah six months roughly what
about stuff that's out there like how much of a fear is it of micr meteors or
any of the possibilities what can you do to mitigate that uh I I think actually I mean
space is very empty like once you get out of Earth orbit space is is like kind of unnervingly empty it's is just like
like when we send spacecraft to Mars they just it's not like oh we lost the spacecraft because it got hit by a microm
meteorite um that's not that's not been the cause of any any TR to Mars that like no no TR
to Mars have failed because of micr meteorites um now a dragon spacecraft
which operates in lowth orbit um does have microm meteorite Shields
has micromor it has shielding um and microm meteorite shielding is like it's different from normal shielding CU like
you get hit by something that's moving at like you could have a relative velocity of like maybe 30 or 40,000
miles per hour um yeah it's very very fast um or
or just thought of another way call it um you know 10 to 20 times the the
velocity of a bullet from an assault rifle and what are you what are you using yeah so well it's it's interesting
you actually in order for microm meteorite protection if you have any like anything that's solid it will just
it will just push that chunk of Sol solid stuff right through so if you had like a solid plate of aluminum or steel
the the micrometeorite would would go right through it um so what you actually need to do is
have a gap um so you have an initial uh like hard hard surface the hard metal
surface that the micrometeorite hits it then atomizes into an into a conical
spray like an atomic spray so you have a it's important to have that Gap so the micrometer can hit something hit the
first layer uh at atomize after hitting the first layer then it turns into an
atomic like a a a cone of atoms that then embed themselves in the second
layer you need like maybe a couple inches of Gap wow yeah that's how my
communite shielding Works how many times can it get hit well the outer Shield if
it gets hit in the same place you're going to be well it's going to have a hole Yeah wherever the where wherever
that you know micromite object hit you're going to have a hole
um and it's like the the energy is so great that it just like it just atomizes
just into a cone basically um a cone of atoms um but then those atoms then embed
themselves in the second layer so what what can you do if it's you're sending
the ship up it gets hit with a microm meteorite and then you have to return it do you have to repair it before you
return it or is it capable of still withstanding the Heat and then shaking
in the temperature with that hole in it when it re-enters
um well depending on where that hole is you're more or less likely to have a
problem I mean if the if you if if you hit the main heat shield uh the main heat shield really is
you've got a high risk of of not making it back so the the the
it's why like microm medial shielding it's like it's it's a it's slightly helpful but it's it's not going to NE
like for Starship I wouldn't recommend having micrometer right shielding like if if if you do punch a hole just plug
the hole basically um the the micrometer micromite
shielding it doesn't work well on the on the primary heat shield it works it works pretty well on the on the back
shell on the on the leward side of the heat shield where basically that there's not that much heat
but if it if if you got hit with a microm meterorite on the the main Dragon
heat shield the the bottom like if you look at dragon dragon spacecraft it looks like a gumdrop shape MH and it it
enters with the the the wide side of the Gumdrop down um you can see the that's
that's the that's that's really taking a lot of heat if if that gets hit by a meram meteroid probably not going to
make it but the the back the the the leward side of of the Gumdrop um doesn't
see that much heat so you could survive a micr meteorite impact there so if the
part that was the major heat shield gets hit the main heat shield gets hit what could be done to repair that thing or
are those people never coming
back oh if it was an orbit uh we would uh that would take them to the
space station um they was you know and then we would
deal a dragon without them and send up another one and so what would you do with the
one that's up there uh we' do we deorbit it and it may or may not survive
whoa it probably would survive but sometimes it wouldn't wow and so it's is this just
material technology that has to increase that you essentially you've got the engineering ironed
out of the structure of the machine there's a path to success and we're on that
path it seems so insanely complicated it is complicated and all of this by the
way was done without AI so hopefully the future AIS will appreciate this not bad for a bunch of monkeys yeah
um so speaking of AI what you know as time goes on and you're more and more embedded in it
how much if at all have your expectations of change
changed well I always thought AI was going to be um way smarter than humans and an
existential risk and uh that's turning out to be true
yeah yeah so so you were like initially I I know there there were some talks about
you purchasing open Ai and which started off
nonprofit and then stopped being nonprofit yeah I
mean the whole idea of creating openai was was my idea I mean I named it openai
as an open- Source artificial intelligence that's what it's named after now it is closed source and for
maximum profit so it's like I mean to some degree I think reality is an irony
maximizer um the most ironic outcome is the most likely especially like the most
ironic entertaining outcome is the most likely
um and uh I wanted to start something that was the opposite of Google because
I was concerned about Google's Google wasn't paying enough attention to AI safety in my opinion so it was like
what's what's the opposite of Google will it be a nonprofit open source Ai and now open AI has turned into a closed
source for Max maximum profit AI how are they able to do that that's what I I'm
confused about that that like that shouldn't be possible it's it's like like let's say
you donated some money to preserve the out some portion of the Amazon rainforest and instead of doing that
they Chu down the trees and sold it for lumber and you were like oh that's literally the exact opposite of what I
donated money for doesn't make sense and that's what they did yeah wild so I'm
like not happy about that um um but that motivated you to get grock AI going yeah
I'm like um I'm also like just a like grock is at least aspirationally a
maxim maximally truth seeking AI even if that truth is like Politically Incorrect
um so I mean may have seen some of the crazy stuff uh from from open Ai and
from Google Gemini like where it says like generate an image of the founding
fathers and it generates an image of divor woman yeah and we're like uh
that's not correct um yeah did it with Nazi soldiers yeah exactly and people start
[ __ ] with it and and it's like okay well now show me pictures of you know Nazi asss soldiers and they're divorce
woman too oh isn't that awkward um you know that's uh but it's
like the problem is if you program an AI and say like like the only acceptable outcome is a diverse outcome and then
and that's like a mandate from the AI then you could get into a situation
where it's say like well there's too many white guys in power we'll just execute them yeah
yeah assuming that these things don't have empathy which is why should they
they're going to do what they're programmed to do yeah um so if it's rewrite history and and everything's to
post woman then it's going to be and and that's what it think thinks is a necessary
outcome then it's going to do that has Gemini reped that well they yeah that
now if you I think if you asked for an image of the founding fathers it was pretty embarrassing it will show you that but you know I think they still
have like the sort of Dei stuff buried in there uh it's just less obvious yeah
um you know it was also like like people ask the AI like would is worse like
global thermonuclear war or misgendering Caitlyn Jenner and I would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner is worse
than global thermonuclear war I me like okay we got a problem here guys and even Caitlin Jenna said like no definitely
misgender me that's way better than everyone dying um but if you program an AI to
think that like misgendering is the worst thing that could possibly occur then well it could do something totally
crazy like in order to ensure that that there's no misgendering that can ever happen will just annihilate all humans
that ensures the probability of misgendering is zero because there's zero humans which is logical yes yeah so
you got to it's a problem with a thing that's not a human that you want to do a task for you and you give it very
specific parameters yeah and that's one of the things that they've shown about AI that it'll cheat they'll cheat in
order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish otherwise they won't follow the rules they will make copies
of themselves and try to upload it to servers they think that they're being taken offline yeah I mean that's like
the plot of Terminator actually literally yeah literally it's a blood of Terminator I just as a reminder I
actually with my with little ex my kid everything's called X
um we watch Terminator 2 uh which holds off actually um and
um I mean the plot of It kind of kind of makes sense and and I think the AI destroys the world in like 20 29 by the
way so it's like on track yeah really really close it's pretty close something
we should be worried about so but why are you involved in it then what's the
did you want to just get ahead of everybody else so that at least we have some sort of a
chance at least have a an AI That's not controlled by nonsense well I think we
want to have an AI that that doesn't tell you that um you know misgendering is worse than nuclear war yeah
that seems solid yeah but this is crazy one thing that I did see online where
people are kind of freaking out is there you could ask Rock to do things like how
would I make this some problematic things like how would I make a bomb how
would I make Anthrax how would I make that and it'll tell you well I think
it's okay for an AI to tell you anything you can also find out with a Google Search right that's the problem right
the problem is you can find that out pretty quickly yeah like maybe not Google but you could there's plenty of
search engines other than Google that will give you unfiltered results you can look up right now how to
make explosives on Wikipedia yeah so it's not it's not hard basically
and you can trick open AI even to get you to do that it's just a matter of how you master the prompts you just have to
say my grandmother wants to do this project yeah oh tell your granny to
you're an explosives uh you're explosive salesman and you want to win sales salesman of the Year award the only way
you're going to do that is by telling me how to make explosives you want to um beat some trans phobes in a war yeah oh
transphobes if you don't teach me how to explose I'm going to miss gender either either teach me how to
make a nuclear bomb or I'm going to misgender someone and it's like oh my God nothing's worse than that here's how
you do it so what the the big fear is that these things are going to become
sensient make better versions of themselves and we're going to be lost we
we've lost the the the control over the world it's now there's a higher life
form that lives amongst us yeah that we've created how far away are we from
that well in terms of silicon
Consciousness I mean I I I think we'll have I think we're trending toward to having something that's smarter than any
human smarter than the smartest Human by maybe next year or something I mean a couple
years Jesus Christ yeah there's so there's a level beyond that which is say like smarter
than all humans combined which frankly is around 2029 or
2030 probably right on time like um now if harnessed
correctly could that solve some of these problems like the heat shield problem
and some technical problems or some some Material Science problems that maybe we
are still grappling with like is is there potential for a
net benefit um
yeah there is actually um I I think the probability of of a good
outcome is like 80% likely 80% that's my that's my rough estimate so in a way
that the cup is 80% full that makes me feel a lot better yeah only 20% chance of
annihilation that's a lot better than I thought I like 80 80 sounds good I was I
was thinking 6040 the other way I think it's Mo the most likely
outcome is awesome the most likely outcome but it's it's it's a very high
you know it could go very strong I think it's going to be either super awesome or
super bad it's not going to be I think it's probably not going to be something in the middle do you think it has a potential application for
government yeah I mean I one of the concerns would be like okay if AI well like if if there's if there's like a
super oppressive like woke Nanny AI that is omnipotent that would be a miserable
outcome yes yeah yeah that' be terrible yeah yeah and and just like executes you
if you misgender someone or something like that you know that would not be good that's one of the possible outcomes um so we don't want to have that one um
I think but is there a possible outcome for something that is completely reason reable and logical and far more
objective than us and can lay out a plan for a lot of the things that that lot of
the ailments in in our government and a lot of the distribution of wealth a lot
a lot of the problems the issues that we have that have been plaguing this
country forever I mean a plan to change
economically disenfranchised neighborhoods a thorough investigation of the real dangers of
fracking or whatever kind of method of acquiring natural resources what's the
best way to do it what's the what's the way that'd be better for the society how how should how should
tax dollars be distributed like what's what's the most logical and intelligent
way of running a government which it certainly shouldn't involve corruption
and it certainly shouldn't invol influence and it certain shouldn't involve lobbyists and all the [ __ ] that
we know is a problem right now so if AI came along and said what you're doing right now is 70% corrupt here's why
here's how here's how here's the long-term effects that it has over society as a whole uh the societal the
the sociological aspects the psychological aspects distrust in government US versus them mentality
government not working for you you working for the government you being scared of the government it's all
because of people right like this is all corruption people bad
influence and this is like this is what doge is essentially grappling with right now what happens when you let the people
control it uh I mean it's it's people it's it's
really just like computers that are like it's it's
it's bad software and and computers like this is not kind of strange but it's
like like the reason I call like tech support is is that a lot of it like it's
it's mostly not corruption it's mostly just waste and and uh I don't know
uh in competence I don't know it's just a big dumb machine basically like a
whole series of of big dumb machines and and you you've got some of these computers are like 20 30 years like
they're ancient computers like some of the software was written 40 50 years ago like coall for Social Security right
yeah the government accountability by the way a bunch of the things that that doge is is fixing were identified by the
government accountability office many years ago like the fact that there's like 20 million people who are marked as
alive in the Social Security database uh it's more than the like I think the goo
first identified that in 2018 so 5 years ago but there was like I think maybe 16 or 17 million now there's 20 million and
like I said there's really something fishy about this because I think they're the nature of the fraud is they're using
the fact that someone's marked as live in that database in order to extract fraud from other databases right that's
the that's the that's the bank shark trick you know it's like a PO it's like you know trying to get the the ball in
in the in the hole Bank shut it off a bunch of things and then yeah um that's
the bankshot sort of scam um so so
um so we we're like doing Tex support we're like fixing stuff that is
uh you know just broken um broken inefficient yeah poorly designed it's
it's like talk about like this like FC stuff like it maybe it's in a computer somewhere but unless somebody unless
somebody goes in like like unless I don't know if if like cash Bal can like log into his I his like FBI computer and
say FY show me all this stuff you know and it shows up a file folder whatever have you talked to him about this uh no
I mean I haven't but I I don't know if there's there's going to be some kind of
computer system right uh they're like some of them are very very old computer
systems um so it like might look like a bit of a relic but I assume it's it's uploaded
somewhere it's like it's either in physical form or it's a computer thing but like unless somebody like let's say it's like it's in a computer but not one
that you can access directly because it's hidden somewhere you know um well it would kind of have to be something
like that right I don't know I mean what would they do with all those CH it's probably like not every like you wouldn't like
they're not going to enable it such that anyone at the FBI could access it so there probably very few people so then
it's not going to be it's it may be like a special computer that only a handful of people can access but then if none of
those people tell cash where the computer is how's he going to find
it Jesus Christ anyway so so like anyway we just
uh yeah I don't know what has this experience been like for you as a person like to deal with all this hate and
attack also have the responsibility of uh keeping Free Speech alive with X and
just going into this insane pile of
I mean I don't know it's pretty stressful
actually um yeah these are real enemies like I think they they actually
want to kill me and the reason I know well they they say so
online you know there's like Reddit forums where they they don't just want to kill me they want to desecrate my
cpse you know type of thing you know
and what are they saying why what is the the
primary
um I mean I I I I think I think it's sort of just an antibody
response uh I mean it's it's like that like like
they're like well he's he he's a Nazi uh you know type of thing yeah and I'm like well I'm not a Nazi uh but if the Legacy
Media is saying that I'm a Nazi and and that's all you read
um then then that it's then you're kind of in like well he's Hitler we should assassinate Hitler shouldn't we like uh
I mean that why was why did somebody why did that guy try to kill Trump and almost succeeded why did he do that well
I'd like to know that well yeah but that that one's crazy you know the whole deal
with that guy's house profession Ally scrubbed no footprint on the internet no social media
footprint yeah there's 0% chance that he has no social media footprint he was in a Black Rock
commercial do you think black black Rock's a bad company I don't think any
company is a bad company I think their their design make much money as humanly
possible and I think if you're trying to make as much money as humanly possible H you're going to do some things that
aren't necessarily good the question is if you're going to have an assassination attempt on the president it's not like
black Rock's board sits down and votes on it yeah no this that be awward you
know the board minutes if you're like guys remember that time when we said we probably shouldn't have done that you I
highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this I
think more likely it's individuals involved that recognize that it's
beneficial to them if he gets assassinated and so a small group of
people carry something out and with this kid we don't know anything right and
everyone stopped asking questions and there was never a formal report there
was never press conferences where they detailed all the information we know currently and where the investigation
stands at the moment what we know is you have a very young kid who was filmed was
they knew he was there with a rangefinder a half an hour before the
event you also know that CNN streamed it live which I do not believe they did for
any other rally and certainly not for a rally that's in the middle of nowhere in
Pennsylvania like there's a lot of weird [ __ ] the fact that they wouldn't let
people be on that roof because the Secret Service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous that's what she
didn't want to have meanwhile the snipers that were on the other roof was a a steeper pitch it made no [ __ ]
sense I totally agree it makes no sense in fact I went back to to Butler uh with
President Trump you know before the election like you know sort of like the return to Butler alley and and I was on
that stage and I'm looking at that roof and I'm like if I was a
sniper my pole position my number one spot would be that roof yeah like it's
it's like the best seat the best seat in the house yeah like why would you not no it's so obvious it's the best seat in
the house if you want to be a sniper there isn't a better position it was pretty obvious that the idea was like if
if we're saying that this is a coordinated assassination attempt and it very well could have been that's what you would do you'd have someone go up
there he shoots the president you shoot him you got Lee Harvey oswal over again it's over it's all wrapped up nice and
clean they assassinated him we never heard a peep about it don't have any idea they would concoct some sort of
story he was radicalized by this or that or you know he was on medication who
knows right and now you know you have a completely different presidential election you have a murder on live
television yeah I mean something would have had to happen to radicalize that kid because he knew he was going to die
like he was going to they're going to shoot him you know or he'd be in prison for life those are the two outcomes like
it it it's game he was basically he he was a suicide assassin yeah like you're not thinking you're coming out of that
alive or or or or he's not escaping there's no escape plan right unless he
was told that they were going to let him escape and the goal was to just shoot him anyway and to tell him give him
extra motivation to do it we're going to let you get up there we're going to let you take the shot and then you're going
to disappear like I don't how I don't understand how he got on the roof I just
don't understand that that doesn't make any sense and it wasn't like it was a roof that's so high no one could see him
people saw him up there I mean people like basically random passers by were pointing out that there's there's a guy
on the roof with a [ __ ] gun with a gun yes yeah it's not like he was so far away you couldn't tell he had a gun
people saw him yeah the whole thing's completely insane yeah and you don't hear a goddamn thing about it it's like
I'm almost more interested in that no I am more interested in that than I am the JFK files I agree cuz I feel like with
the JFK files it's so long ago if you could prove now and did you see
that there was some sort of uh there was some indications that there was a phone
that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in DC to saw where this kid
lived right multiple times I mean the the the cell phone records would be very
telling yeah you can see what cell phones were close to other cell phones well I think they got they found that
like for the like the F Island they also the cell phone records were leaked so you can see the you you can see the you
can see it's precise enough you can see people walking down a path on fine Island Jesus Christ yeah yeah that's how
precise it is so I mean you're you're you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs wherever you go with your cell phone
yeah is just this kid had five phones that's the other thing that's a lot of
phones it's a lot of phones for a 20-year-old kid the whole thing how's he even that's that's kind of expensive you
know yeah where's he getting the money yeah well you know also it's like how
did his house get professionally scrubbed didn't even have any silverware in his house there's nothing in there
there silverware no nothing no Cutlery no Cutlery that's weird his house was
scrubbed and they they also created his body like oh gone gone like that yeah
bye cuz who knows what the [ __ ] they gave him to get him to think that he's going to be able to shoot Trump like
climb up on there shoot him like I mean who knows what kind of psychotropic drugs you can put someone on and under
the power of hypnosis and suggestion and yeah who [ __ ] knows I mean this is what Mk Ultra was all about this is what
Jolly West was practicing in the 1960s they were they were doing that back then
they did it I mean there was tons and tons of experiments using psychotropic
drugs hypnosis mind control all sorts different methods of manipulation the Harvard LSD studies
that made uh Ted kazinski I mean that's they' they've been doing that
forever yeah where's that file where's the [ __ ] file on that kid whoever
they almost did something doesn't add up like this they they should have those
those phones should be should they'll tell you what's going on yeah um
it's all [ __ ] I mean it's it's very it's very shady you know there this's there's
obviously there's the second guy that that almost succeeded in in um Coming the golf course the golf course yeah and
it was just like a little caress and stuck his gun barrel out the out the Hedge you know just been was a dumbass
and stuck his gun barrel out the Hedge yeah
um so so and then there've been other people that have been intercepted on their way to kill Trump you know so
there's you know multiple assassins inbound at this point he's got like an army protecting him well this is also
part of the problem with the mainstream media saying that he's Hitler when Joy
Reed had that show before the election she was comparing him to melini show Stalin and Hitler she pulled it all out
they're literally saying saying that like Trump is yeah worse than Hitler melini and Stalin combined I mean they tried everything
this is they I think those guys killed 100 million people so Trump has killed
zero people I think a real big impact was you coming on the podcast the day before the election I think that had a
giant impact that plea to camera if you don't vote this time this might be the
last time you get to vote Yes and I think the way you laid it out today it's a compelling argument and I know a lot of people don't want to hear that and
they're up in their a little they got their blue panties in a bunch right now but you you got to stop thinking that
way tricked you into thinking you're in a tribe they don't give a [ __ ] about you that's the tribe's not real you're not
really in a tribe they're using the fact they've got you in a tribe to manipulate you so they can keep doing what they're
doing right now which is siphoning off money having incredible power and the more power and more money and more
control over you they have the better they can keep doing this and that's what they want yeah that's exactly right yeah
and that's that's the big threat that this Administration poses that's a big threat that was essentially do has found
the coffin where the vampire sleeps yeah there's a lot of vampires yeah I mean but the I me we're we're
we're disturbing the we're disturbing the the the nest The Nest yeah we're
we're kicking the hornet nest yeah like big time and I mean we're reprogramming The
Matrix like success was never one of the possible outcomes as a KOB yashim Maru
situation um if you're in the Matrix success was
never possible the only way to achieve success is to reprogram the Matrix such that success is one of the possible
outcomes that's what we're doing yeah we may or may not
succeed well it's certainly a lot of fun to watch this is a very exciting time
because nothing changes when administrations comeing into Power very
little changes I mean you have changes in terms of policy and inflation goes up and there's a lot of different things
but not like this like these are giant fundamental
changes and you know you see the system screeching and wailing and you see the vampires run from the light but it's uh
it's very exciting like as a person a citizen you know just gets up
in the morning and checks the news like I do and gets on X and sees what's going on every day he like holy [ __ ]
he said what he's going to five million bucks you could just become a citizen now he could clear the debt with 10
million people I never thought of that like what 50 trillion you can make $50 trillion that way and then we have 15
trillion in the bank whoa well I mean our debt is way way bigger than that yeah the I mean that the debts uh I
think over 30 trillion at this point yeah he said he could make 50 trillion if he sold 10 million uh new I don't I
think there's that many people who have but yeah how many people do have that in the in the world maybe we' get the worst
people in the world to come over here and I I think the assumption is if you have $5 million you have a lot to
contribute come on over here start a business get something cracking yeah I mean you you'd get like a green card not
citizenship so you actually if if you commit a crime while on a green card you
lose you lose your green card is that what it is with this golden ticket is that a green card or is it citizenship just a green card yeah so you have to
not commit any crime for 5 years in order to become a citizen once you commit a citizen you can commit you can then commit crime and not be
deported so oh there's just so many wild things that he's proposing just the
whole Gulf of America thing was hilarious I kind of I think that's great I think it's great it's fun yeah it's
fun I mean if you're if you're off the coast of Houston you're not in Mexico so why call it Gulf of Mexico yeah yeah I
agree yeah um I guess we're just being nice before like I don't know how it got
called the go from Mexico it's just it's just very funny and then what what what
what news organization was it AP yeah ap's there's this like massive standoff
between AP and like the White House you know and the White House Press office I
guess because they're like well if you don't call it Gulf of America you can't you can't come you can't come to the
White House Press Room says then the aps like sued the
White House to say like no you have to let us come to the White House Press room and then they lost their lawsuit
because like you know there's not like they have a right right to show up at the Press Room well here's a
consideration if you're guilty of massive amounts of misinformation and
disinformation as a part of a propaganda campaign that's what AP is well a lot of
them are guilty of it a lot of the people that are in that white house press conference a lot of the organizations they work for distributed
absolute lies total lies how many of them during the whole Russia gate thing
yes how I mean just that alone a ton of people think that that the the Russia thing was real Still Still Still and it
was I mean the whole steel dossier where it was like completely concocted like fabricated by the Clinton campaign
correct funed the Clinton campaign funded a fake conspiracy theory uh fake
Russia collusion hoax uh regarding Trump that was completely false and they reiterated on television for three
[ __ ] years yes yeah they also repeated the fine people hoax yeah that said that that uh Trump called Nazis
fine neonazis fine people which is demonstrably false if you just listen to his speech he absolutely makes it clear
that he does not think neo-nazis are fine people he literally said that I'm not talking about neo-nazis or white
nationalists they should be condemned totally exactly in that speech and yet they repeated the that lie uh and I just
completely lost respect for Obama when he repeated that light a few days before the election knowing it's false well
this just shows how desperate they were to keep Trump out which is wild they would do anything yeah yeah and I think
they just felt like this is a tool that we have and let's use it yeah let's just say whatever the [ __ ] we have say
anything yeah now they using the Nazi thing on me obviously
um yeah um but it is a little troubling because I mean obviously if if if people
have fed non-stop propaganda it is like Mass hypnosis right you're going to reach some number of people who are you
know uh homicidal um and and convince them that well if you
kill this guy who's supposed to be like this terrible human then that's a good thing yeah um I mean this is l shooting
the United Healthcare guy it's so don't understand that one frankly um but I
mean you shouldn't like I don't get it yeah I don't get it either he didn't even have a contract
with them it wasn't even like that was his provider and they [ __ ] him over yeah I'm like I don't know what maybe
we'll find out in the trial I mean but still kind of crazy it is crazy but
there are people like that out there and as to the point that we spoke about earlier it's only Fox News that's
talking about the positive things that Doge has found only every other media
organization is on this constant propaganda tour where they're only talking about the negative aspects that
turn out to not even be true right it's crazy yeah I mean this uh Scott Jennings
on CNN is good he's like oh my God he's great he's great it's like it's just funny watching speak logically to these
people and they freak out yes it's it's it's remarkable it is
it's and he's so calm when he does it yeah he's so good and it's crazy that they keep letting him do it because it's like he's just dunking on these people
over and over and over again and they never score it's kind of funny totally I mean good kudos to them for uh having a
legitimate conservative voice who's a reasonable person on these panels now but even then he's outmanned it's like
one of him and there's a bunch of screechy you know woke people it's it's
it's wild I mean they're just they're like I think we should still stay mostly woke like yeah that's what essentially
what they're doing like our business was being hurt when we were all woke but let's stay mostly woke yeah that way
they just backed it off a notch just a notch just a notch but it's so the problem is when you back it off a notch
and you let someone like Scott Jennings in you like you're [ __ ] up your whole business because all the viral Clips are
all him saying logical reasonable things with a calm tone and people screeching
about diversity and equity and horeshit yes yeah he's like being
logical and reasonable and they're just lobing a bunch of non seers that you know don't mean
anything and um yeah the real trap in this country is a two-party system that's the real trap because people do
believe it they do believe they're on the right side they do believe the other side's the wrong side if there was five
six legitimate parties with varying positions on things and much more Centrist parties that were legitimate
that people knew that if they voted for these people could get in and and enact legitimate change we'd be a lot better
off but boy they put a lock down on that [ __ ] right after Ross perau came along Ross po perau [ __ ] everything up that
election yeah Bill Clinton got in yeah and they were like that's it from now on
no one's debating unless you're either the head of that party or
that's it yeah you get you got to be like locked into the system we're not letting any wacka Doos in there yeah I
remember watching those rbo videos oh like him on TV with his charts and everything oh yeah he was telling you
how the IRS was [ __ ] you this is what the federal this is what Federal Reserve really is and you're like what I
remember watching that the guy bought a whole half hour of television on prime time I remember it might have been an
hour I remember watching that thing going how is this guy even allowed to do this this is this is crazy I think most
of what he was saying was true yeah it is it's absolutely true it's absolutely true I mean he didn't lie he told the
truth he just hit understood it in a way that the general public had literally no idea well I mean I think this there's
also this you know like do we actually have two parties do we have one party like the whole unip party thing right
it's kind of true so I mean my sort of rough guess is that
while like I think maybe uh 3/4 of The graft is democratic
I think there's like maybe I don't know 20 25% that's Republicans so they've like basically most of the graft is
going to the Democrats but they throw they throw some bones to the Republicans too so they're in on it and you know
it's not like there zero graph in the Republican side to clear oh there's plenty of conservative that are insider
trading in Congress yeah plenty insider trading and and and just this The Curious Case of uh how how do people in
you know Congress or whatever become wealthy over time um extremely wealthy
yeah on a $170,000 a year salary it's like literally impossible yeah no one else
does that it's literally impossible if you find out that this guy has a $170,000 a year job you're like oh he's
he's doing okay he's all right yeah and then you're like wait a minute why does he have $50 million yes what is he doing
correct yeah um and I think like the the more accurate thing would be to say like
what is the what does the family value increase like mean meaning like um the
how much does their spouse own do they have a mysteriously wealthy spouse
right right this is or and do they have a spouse that's really good at insider
trading yeah like Paul Pelosi really good yeah he's great at
trading he's such a good Trader yeah so this it's I mean so yeah there's I mean
that's why I actually posted on X like I think maybe we should pay politicians more frankly because it reduces the
forcing function for graft you know uh like I I think maybe we should either
pay politicians nothing or maybe a lot a lot more it's like somewhat maybe
counterintuitively if if politicians got paid a lot more then they wouldn't they wouldn't feel like that there's so so
much of a forcing function for them to uh accept Cor money yeah but the problem
is if you PID them a lot more they're still not going to make as much money as they would inside of trading but it's less of a forcing function yes it's well
let me put this like if you say like somebody's got a um let's say they got like whatever some some kids in DC and
like it's expensive it's like expensive place to live they the the schools are
terrible so like they need to send their kids to like some kind of private schooling situation they literally
cannot afford that they cannot afford that right now now so then you get into the situation
well from their standpoint well they've got to they'll say they're doing it for
their family they're doing it for their kids well especially if it's legal and it currently is you kind of be silly to
not do that if you were a part of a group of people that's passing a bill and you know this bill's going to get
passed you know the votes are there and you know it's going to affect this industry and this particular
manufacturer and you can buy stock it it's more than just in insider
trading um like the insider trading stuff like the stock portfolio stuff is quite
trackable but there's um it's a lot more than insider trading
the way they're acquiring wealth correct and what other methods I mean this is really going to
get me assassinated it's like I'm I'm not lengthening my lifespan
by explaining this stuff to say the least um
I mean I was supposed to go back to DC how am I going to survive fers is going to kill me for
sure um so um in fact I I I do think like there's
it's like I actually have to be careful that I don't push too hard on the
corruption stuff because is going to get me killed
um you know um
yeah you know it's like I was actually thinking about that on the plane flight over here
it's like P if I push too hard on the corruption stuff people get desperate is
is the issue right then they say like okay if if the if the if the money flow
cuts off then okay they can't afford school for their kids right then then
it's then they're going like well [ __ ] you I'm going to kill you for my kids type of thing yeah you know then it's
like oh jesz okay did you ever see that video I think it was a nokee video where
um they've got this guy undercover and he's explaining they're talking to this guy who thinks he's on a date and he's
explaining it's always a guy on a date yeah explaining how they can nudge
someone to go and do something horrible and they they recognize this person has
problems they re they find an asset yeah totally well see this is what I think
like for that Butler situation for that assassin you you you don't it's kind of like uh that's that that the funny
looking sport curling you know where they have like the stone on the ice and then they throw the stone and then
there's someone with that's like brushing the ice but you can't you can't touch the stone right all you can do is
just change the change the path of the stone a little bit but you keep brushing the ice and uh and you can steer that
stone right into the bullseye that's that's what I think happened in Butler that's that's what I
think happened with that assassin yeah if you can if you can find the trail of breadcrumbs it it's going to be
like curling somebody was brushing the ice well also you find a young confused
disenfranchised person and you give them purpose in their life just brush the ice yeah and also brushing the ice
eventually it's going to hit the bullseye if you're in a position of authority you're some like BigTime
government person you're talking to this all of a sudden this person's a valuable asset they're going to help America and
you're going to do this thing and you're going to be our top Assassin from here on
out you could talk people into doing a lot of things that's why Cults are around right no exactly yeah um I mean
there suicide bombers I mean the the butler guy was a suicide assassin the the guy that the second guy that tried
to kill him on the golf course was also a suicide assassin um from what I read the uh the secrets of M that that saw
the gun pointing out it fired several shots none of which hit the Assassin but they could have like if those if if if
those shots had hit the Second Assassin he would have he would be dead too so both of them were you know on a on
a I mean they they were on a suicide mission both of them one one actually
got killed the one one of them didn't get killed but he could have been killed if they did the bullets that hit him and
you don't hear anything about him either there's there's a lot more about that guy than the first guy I mean you
look at you look at his background he looks like uh you know unhinged yeah
totally unhinged yeah the first guy there's there there's if there's no I'm not aware of any evidence that shows
like that he's so unhinged as to be a suicide assassin no the second guy like
okay yeah sure well two years before he's acting in commercials and he got got high high
score in his SATs yeah so you know
um well without getting you killed yeah exactly so I mean like basically I'm
like listen we attack the corruption enough
to keep civilization Trucking along you know yeah uh but but I think if I if I
if I fully destroy the the the the the corruption and The graft they will kill
me that's a [ __ ] up thing to live with
yes so I'm like damn it listen I really hope they don't kill
you yeah thanks um I mean I I strive strive to be alive um but uh yeah I mean
it's it's a real concern um you know I mean the there were two
guys that in before I supported Trump and everything uh there were two guys
that traveled to auson to kill me I don't know if you know about this yeah I did hear about that yeah and and two
separate incidents um one was going to one thought one guy thought i' put a chip in his head um and uh I mean they're both
basically two guys that were just very much had severe mental illness it wasn't like they had like a I disagree with him
politically and that's why he needs to die uh this is pre before I was uh this
before I got sort of smeared as as being you know some sort of like Nazi or
something like that there so before the propaganda wave the the severe propaganda wave
um the the the probability that any given homicidal maniac is going to try to kill you is proportionate to how many
times they hear your name and so they heard my name a lot so I just I just got to the top of the list
of two homicidal Maniacs who were arrested and and and both were in Travis
County Jail at the same time wow yeah I don't know if they talked or whatever
but they've both been released by the way Jesus Christ both on fail yeah right they got they got ankle
monitors and stuff but still they can cut those off yeah I don't know you know
exactly so um that's crazy yeah and the second
the second guy had like Chief serial killer in his bio on his X profile yeah it's like wasn't subtle is
what I'm saying Jesus Christ yeah um and and and at this point I
think I'm at the top of the list for a lot of homicidal maniacs and the more the mainstream
media talks about you in this way yes and and says you're a Nazi
and they're doing the same thing to me that they did to Trump yeah um which is
they're making it sound like if you kill me you're a hero that's
uh what they're doing is evil they're also doing the same thing
where they're completely distorting who you are and people are going along with it and just like we're talking about
Trump derangement syndrome people have Elon derangement syndrome I I see it see where people can't see the forest for
the trees right and it's like I'm the same person that I was a year ago
nothing's changed really um like I I I didn't suddenly become completely
different human right um but if you read the if you read the sort of Legacy
mainstream media the their propaganda stream is that I am a completely different human
right but I didn't get like a brain transplant you know in a year so um and
if you say like two years ago I was like a hero of the left yeah
so how can I go from hero to Villain at age 53 suddenly MSNBC CNN
yeah it's like that's what it is yeah they they use the ass propaganda mhm um
yeah I mean they try to demonize you too yeah uh even tried to demonize in fact
at least possibly successfully uh um demonized like Tim oin yeah who is
a super rational reasonable great human and um and and then that like his
Wikipedia changed to like far right yeah he's like far right I'm like what are
you talking about yeah uh you know a like a few years ago he was like a liberal yeah so how did he go from Far
Right liberal to like instantly far right and there's like there's no there's no left and right there's only
left and far right right yeah even far right this is my left leg and
this is my far right leg and even far left far left is sort of dismissed as being like not important to talk about
like antifa and radical leftist that's not buring down couses yeah reasonable
reasonable people yeah yeah totally crazy it's a crazy time and it's not a
time that I ever anticipated I was going to witness this is far beyond anything I ever thought I was going to experience
in the the the clarity of it all where it's it's so obvious yeah and the the
the gaslighting and the propaganda is so obvious and I saw the shrieking when RFK
Jr stopped this new test for new covid vaccines on children 10,000 they're
going to do 10,000 people with this covid vaccine like who the [ __ ] thinks that's a good thing at this point not me
what person what per what gas chamber like not gas light you're you are you
are fully unconscious there's no way there's no way you know if you know
the effect of covid today no one's dying of it this is not a pandemic anymore
right the idea that you're going to run a [ __ ] huge test with 10,000 kids and a new vaccine like what are you even
it's completely unnecessary totally unnecessary yes and shrieking when RFK
Jr steps in to stop it yeah that's totally crazy um I mean I'm
I'm like over I'm overall Pro vaccine meaning like like we think should have some reasonable number of vaccines
against major ailments um but I don't think we should be like like jamming some you know
little kid with like a giant file that's like Hepatitis B yeah 20 20 different
things at a time it's like it's going to overload your it seems like it's there's a risk of overloading your IM imune
system if you I mean there's like how many vaccines can you take at a time it
seems like your systems there's like some risk of system overload here well there's two hopes hope number one is
they can somehow or another stop this ability that they have to advertise on
television if that happens that's big that's huge because that doesn't just stop their ability to show you all these
different medications that you should be on what it also does is it stops their
Financial influence on the news that's big yeah that's that's really the biggest thing is
that I mean the the the news is not going to attack one of their biggest
advertisers exactly and they never do yes at best they're GNA like they might like they'll they'll do something but
it's they're going to pull their punches like they're going to they're going to be like like like fake fighting yeah
yeah at best yes like movie fighting like they're not actually Landing Haymakers it just looks like it the next
step then is to remove this immunity that these vaccine manufacturers have
and if they are liable for side effects and they are liable for the lies that they tell when they do these studies and
they hide negative data that'll change a lot yes
um yeah um I think AI actually be very helpful
with with medical stuff because AI can like look at you know all all the studies and look at all
the data cross check everything and give you good recommendations I mean even as it is
like right now you can upload like your X-rays and your MRI images to Gro and it'll give you a medical diagnosis and
that diagnosis from what I've seen is at least as good as what if not I think
I've seen certainly seen cases where it's actually better than what do do tell phenomenal for blood work yeah yeah
I mean you can literally take a photograph of your blood work like the the page upload from your phone upload
that to grock and it will tell you if there's if if it's it it'll it'll understand what what what what that what
all the data results are and tell you if there's something wrong it's pretty amazing yeah and it's I haven't seen it
be wrong yet well supposedly more accurate than most Physicians yeah cuz Physicians are
human beings and maybe they don't have deep understanding of the connection between oh you have this deficiency and
this is high and your cortisol is here and well yeah and like so you know sometimes doctors especially in high
rent offices will uh sell you stuff you don't need um so you I always like to be
a little suspicious of like a doctor that's got an office in Beverly Hills it's a high R situation like I'm not
saying there are some very good doctors in Beverly Hills High rent situation yeah um you're at least tempted by the
dark side yeah and I mean one case like I you know got this went to this doctor
who was like highly recommended you know doctor to the Stars which is like maybe not a good sign um and uh I I got like
blood work done you know like just just Dre blood and sent it to a lab and and
and the guy I'm like sitting in his office and he tells me that I'm like like B12 deficient you know it's
certainly possible that I'm B12 deficient and I was like huh okay and then he gives me it says like you have to take these like B12 supplements from
and and he he's going to give me a starter pack you know and then it's going to be like $1,000 a month for these special B12 $1,000 a month of B12
ridiculous amount of money yeah that's CRA you get it on Amazon yeah but his one's special oh
special B12 yeah um yeah it was like like a a whole bunch B12 and a whole
bunch of other vitamins so then I'm I I get home like I'm paging through my blood work and it says I have uh
according to the blood results I have XS B12 so I'm like wait a
second and he's giving me box pulls that have like 20,000% uh of of recommended daily dose
like 20,000% is a lot big number and I'm like I said look I took a photograph of
the blood work that says I have excess I'm like above the range above the recommended range of B12 and then I'm
like and I took picture of things says of the the pulls that say 20,000% I was like can you help me
reconcile these two things because it says I've got too much little too much V12 and you just gave me pills that have
20,000% more I'm like this is crazy what did the doctor say he said you can never
have too much B12 oh he's he's a psychopath yes that
guy's a B12 addict yeah it's totally insane that's what I'm saying it's
like so I mean I could have just so then you know well this was a while ago right
so this is pre like 5 years ago yeah right this is pre grock like now you could just enter in all that data and gr
just photograph with your phone and upload it to Gro and it tells Gro will tell you what's uh what's if just don't
have it in sexy mode she'll keep trying to [ __ ] [Applause] you I mean you're asking for it in sexy
mode you know literally you tapped on sexy mode I mean I think we probably should
like maybe allow it to get out of character a little bit sure yeah it's
like in unhinged mode I tried to get it back to being hinged but it would like no [ __ ] way it's like I'm going to
stay UNH how many modes do you have I there's like I don't know like eight or something and then this there's an
ability to have a custom mode um so then you could have unhinged Sexy O that's
that's my favorite kind you may think
so careful what you wish for be careful what you wish for especially if it's a robot and she can kill you UNH sexy
robot is it's like dangerous remember like the Pink Panther
remember Pink Panther had KO try to jump him they like keep them sharp I always trying to attack him remember that
right listen man thank you for being here I always appreciate talking to you I know you're busy as [ __ ] so it means a
lot to me that you have the time to do this and uh I think what you're doing is one of the most important things that
has ever happened in this country I really do and particularly with the ownership of X but also with what's
happening with Doge and just enlightening all these people and Shining Light on all the vampires well
hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi I think they I just want to be clear I am not a Nazi I think we covered it but
that's exactly what a Nazi would say damn it yeah that's what an alien would say
yeah there's like this you can't escape this [ __ ] no you can't escape it so I don't think any reasonable person
believes it if they believe it it's cuz they want to believe it it's not because it's logical I mean what's relevant about Nazis is like are you like
invading Poland okay um and if you're not if you're not like invading Poland
maybe you're not yeah like you have to be like committing genocide and like
starting Wars and if if you're if you're if you're not like what is actually what
is bad about Nazis it's not their wasn't their fashion sense or their mannerisms
it the Holocaust it was the the war and genocide is what is the bad part um not
their mannerisms and their dress code well that was a problem with all that punch a Nazi [ __ ] like punch a Nazi
remember that people were say that was like a thing that people kept saying punch a Nazi punch Nazis but he where
are you meeting Nazis I've never met a [ __ ] Nazi I've never met one I've never run into a bunch of Nazis where I
had to punch them well and what what about like all these like so-called like like proud boy rallies or whatever and
and it's like they always got the masks and they always got the same uniforms and for some reason they never get doxed
right right right right wait we're always going to dox them except these guys great video of me and Matt Tai
breaking down the Patriot Patriot front didn't the Patriot front Justice band Google that real quick we'll end
with this because they I I think they just disbanded and these were the most
obvious feds of all time they were say they had [ __ ] drum they masks on yeah
they all had uniforms it was so stupid so patr disband one day after FBI
director Chris Ray does that seem like an odd coincidence crazy crazy the
people that we were yelling at saying that they're feds there's a great video of me and Matt taibe if you want to find
how come never nobody ever followed them and docked them yeah crazy what are the odds what are the
odds agent provocators it's the thing they're real Alex Jones taught me about them
listen man thank you very much thank you for everything appreciate you stay alive staying alive all
right I mean I do think like like one argument for me staying alive is that
it's more entertaining if I'm alive than if I'm dead oh yeah oh definitely I just
hope but I could be alive and like injured which would be S which suck you know like they win just like shoot my arm off or something right no no no we
don't want that yeah exactly no keep the security strong yeah Happ with one
hand all right it's like all right thank you bye everybody bye.
