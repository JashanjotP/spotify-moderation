Now that was the original list. We've added a few words since then. We've added fart, turd and twat. And I know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about, why they haven't been considered, why they haven't shown up on the list thus far. We're looking at them all very closely. Some of your favorites might make the list this year. Asshole, ball, bag, hard on piss, hard, blue balls, taint, nookie, snatchbox,",
